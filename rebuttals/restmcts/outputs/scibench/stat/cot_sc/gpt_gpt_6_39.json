This means that the rate parameter, lambda, is 1/2 (since the mean of an exponential distribution is 1/lambda).\n\n2. The probability that an empty cab arrives within a time interval of t minutes is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution: P(X <= t) = 1 - e^(-lambda*t).\n\n3. Since the arrival of cabs is independent, the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes is the product of the probabilities that each couple gets a cab within 6 minutes.\n\n4. Let A, B, and C be the events that the first, second, and third couple respectively get a cab within 6 minutes. Then the probability that all three couples get a cab within 6 minutes is given by: P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C).\n\n5. Using the exponential distribution CDF formula, we can calculate P(A), P(B), and P(C) as follows:\nP(A) = 1 - e^(-1/2 * 6) = 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.9502\nP(B) = 1 - e^(-1/2 * 6) = 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.9502\nP(C) = 1 - e^(-1/2 * 6) = 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.9502\n\n6. Finally, we calculate the probability that all three couples get a cab within 6 minutes:\nP(A and B and C) = 0.9502 * 0.9502 * 0.9502 ≈ 0.8574\n\nTherefore, the probability that the doorman will get all three couples taken care of within 6 minutes is approximately 0.8574.",

For the first student, there are 11 numbers that they can roll (any number other than 1). The same applies to the second student, and so on. Therefore, the number of outcomes without a match is 11 * 11 * 11 * ... * 11 (12 times) = 11^12.\n\n3. Calculate the probability of no match occurring. This is the number of outcomes without a match divided by the total number of outcomes: (11^12) / (12^12).\n\n4. Finally, calculate the probability of at least one match occurring by subtracting the probability of no match from 1: 1 - (11^12) / (12^12).\n\n5.
