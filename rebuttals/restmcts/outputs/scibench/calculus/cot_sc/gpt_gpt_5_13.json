The divergence theorem states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field over the region enclosed by the surface.\n\n2.

How much work is done?\r\n The unit of the answer should be  $\\mathrm{J}$.",
    "solution": "1. We first need to find the total weight being lifted, including the bucket, water, and the rope. The total weight is 10 kg (bucket) + 36 kg (water) + 0.8 kg/m * 12 m (rope) = 10 + 36 + 9.6 = 55.6 kg.\n\n2. The work done in lifting the bucket is equal to the force required to lift it multiplied by the distance it is lifted. The force required to lift it is the weight of the bucket plus water plus rope, which is 55.6 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity) = 545.68 N.\n\n3. The distance the bucket is lifted is 12 m.\n\n4. To approximate the required work by a Riemann sum, we can divide the distance into small intervals, calculate the force required to lift the bucket at each interval, and then sum up the work done at each interval.\n\n5. The Riemann sum can be expressed as: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} F(x_i) \\Delta x_i$, where $F(x_i)$ is the force required at interval $i$ and $\\Delta x_i$ is the width of interval $i$.\n\n6. As the bucket is lifted at a constant speed, the force required remains constant at 545.68 N and the intervals are all equal at 12/n m.\n\n7. The Riemann sum can be simplified to $545.68 \\times 12/n \\times n$, which simplifies to 545.68 * 12 = 6548.16 J.\n\n8.

    "solution": "1. Let's denote the number of infected people at the beginning of the week as $I_0$ and at the end of the week as $I_t$. We are given that $I_0 = 160$ and $I_t = 1200$.\n\n2. According to the model, the rate of spread is jointly proportional to the number of infected people and the number of uninfected people. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = kI(N-I)$$\nwhere $I$ is the number of infected people, $N$ is the total population, and $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3. We can rewrite this differential equation as:\n$$\\frac{dI}{I(N-I)} = kdt$$\n\n4. Integrating both sides, we get:\n$$\\int \\frac{dI}{I(N-I)} = \\int kdt$$\n\n5. This integral can be solved using partial fractions:\n$$\\int \\left(\\frac{1}{I} + \\frac{1}{N-I}\\right)dI = \\int kdt$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{N-I}\\right) = kt + C$$\n\n6. To determine the constant of integration, we can use the initial conditions $I(0) = I_0$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{N-I_0}\\right) = C$$\n\n7. Substituting the values $I_0 = 160$ and $N = 5000$ into the equation, we can solve for $C$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{5000-160}\\right) = C$$\n$$C = \\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{4840}\\right)$$\n\n8. Now we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{N-I}\\right) = kt + \\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{4840}\\right)$$\n\n9. We are interested in finding the time it takes for $80\\%$ of the population to become infected, which means when $I = 0.8N$. Substituting this into the equation, we can solve for $t$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8N}{N-0.8N}\\right) = kt + \\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{4840}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{0.2}\\right) = kt + \\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{4840}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln(4) = kt + \\ln\\left(\\frac{160}{4840}\\right)$$\n\n10.
