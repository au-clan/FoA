    "solution": "Step 1: We'll use the ideal gas law for this problem, which is PV=nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nStep 2: First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin because the gas constant (R) uses Kelvin. The conversion formula is K = °C + 273.15. So, T = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K.\n\nStep 3: We know that n = 10.0 mol, V = 4.860 dm^3, and T = 300.15 K. The value of R depends on the units we use. Since the problem asks for the pressure in atm and the volume is in dm^3, we'll use R = 0.0821 atm.dm^3/mol.K.\n\nStep 4: Now we substitute these values into the ideal gas law and solve for P. The equation becomes: P = nRT/V = (10.0 mol * 0.0821 atm.dm^3/mol.K * 300.15 K) / 4.860 dm^3.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the above expression to find the pressure. After performing the calculation, we get P = 50.57 atm.\n\nSo, the pressure exerted by the ethane is 50.57 atm.",
