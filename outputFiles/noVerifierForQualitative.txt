No, that gives 26, which is too high.\n- 6 * 4 - 5? That’s 24 - 5 = 19, not 24.\n- 6 * 4 / 1? No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

No, as 2.67 is not an integer.\n\nGiven these options, the only straightforward way to reach 24 from 4, 5, and 6 is:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, with 5 remaining unused, which is acceptable if the goal is to reach 24 with the numbers used appropriately.\n\nSince the task is to reach exactly 24 using all numbers, we need to consider whether the leftover number (5) is acceptable or not.\n\nIn the standard 24 game, all four numbers must be used exactly once to reach 24.\n\nIn the initial step, only 13 - 9 = 4 is performed, reducing the set from {5, 6, 9, 13} to {4, 5, 6}.\n\nAssuming the next step is to use all remaining numbers to reach 24, then the formula must involve 4, 5, 6 with all used once.\n\nLet\'s test possible formulas:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, leftover 5, but 5 isn\'t used.\n\n- Try to use 5: 5 * 4 = 20, then 20 + 6?

No, that’s 24, but we\'ve already used 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to combine the numbers differently.\n\nGiven the initial step, and assuming the goal is to reach 24 with the current left numbers, the key is whether the formula:\n\n**"4 * 6 = 24"** is valid, with remaining number 5.\n\nSince only 4 and 6 are used here, and 5 remains unused, but if the question is whether the formula is correct and can lead to 24, then:\n\n- The formula: 6 * 4 = 24 (left: 5)\n\n- Is this formula correct? Yes, 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n- Is it legal? Yes, multiplication of two numbers.\n\n- Does it lead to 24? Yes.\n\n- Are we using all numbers? No, because 5 remains unused, but the question is about the correctness of the formula and whether it can lead to 24, not necessarily using all numbers at each step.\n\nGiven that, the label for the formula:\n\n**"6 * 4"** (left: 5): **sure**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**"6 * 4"**', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt step by step.\n\nGiven initial numbers: 5, 6, 9, 13\n\nStep 1: 13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4, 5, 6)\n\nFrom this step, the left numbers are 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, considering the feedback, we need to evaluate formulas involving these left numbers (4, 5, 6) to reach 24.\n\nSince only the step 13 - 9 = 4 was provided, and it is confirmed as correct (since the feedback says "Step 1: 13 - 9 = 4"), we now evaluate potential formulas with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n**Note:** The user asked to label formulas with the left numbers from each step.

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

No, because 5 remains unused, but the question is about the correctness of the formula and whether it can lead to 24, not necessarily using all numbers at each step.\n\nGiven that, the label for the formula:\n\n**"6 * 4"** (left: 5): **sure**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**"6 * 4"**', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt step by step.\n\nGiven initial numbers: 5, 6, 9, 13\n\nStep 1: 13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4, 5, 6)\n\nFrom this step, the left numbers are 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, considering the feedback, we need to evaluate formulas involving these left numbers (4, 5, 6) to reach 24.\n\nSince only the step 13 - 9 = 4 was provided, and it is confirmed as correct (since the feedback says "Step 1: 13 - 9 = 4"), we now evaluate potential formulas with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n**Note:** The user asked to label formulas with the left numbers from each step. Since only one step was provided, I will now evaluate possible formulas with the current left numbers (4, 5, 6).\n\n---\n\n**Possible formulas with left numbers 4, 5, 6:**\n\n1. 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 4, 5, 6): **sure**  \n   Explanation: Using 4 and 6, 4 * 6 = 24, which directly gives 24. This is a valid formula.\n\n2. 5 * 4 + 4 = 24? No, 5 * 4 = 20, 20 + 4 = 24, but we only have 4, 5, 6 left, so adding another 4 again is not possible unless we use 4 twice. Since only one 4 is left, this is invalid.\n\n3. 5 * 6 - 6 = 24? No, 5 * 6 = 30, 30 - 6 = 24, but again, only one 6 is left, so subtracting 6 once is valid, but we need to check if the operation is legal.\n\nActually, in standard 24 game rules, each number can be used once unless specified otherwise. Since only one 6 is left, subtracting 6 once is valid.\n\n- 5 * 6 - 6 = 24 (left: 4, 5, 6): **sure**  \n   Explanation: 5 * 6 = 30; 30 - 6 = 24. Valid and leads to 24.\n\n4. 6 + 6 + 4 + 4?

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

Yes, 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n- Is it legal? Yes, multiplication of two numbers.\n\n- Does it lead to 24? Yes.\n\n- Are we using all numbers? No, because 5 remains unused, but the question is about the correctness of the formula and whether it can lead to 24, not necessarily using all numbers at each step.\n\nGiven that, the label for the formula:\n\n**"6 * 4"** (left: 5): **sure**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**"6 * 4"**', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt step by step.\n\nGiven initial numbers: 5, 6, 9, 13\n\nStep 1: 13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4, 5, 6)\n\nFrom this step, the left numbers are 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, considering the feedback, we need to evaluate formulas involving these left numbers (4, 5, 6) to reach 24.\n\nSince only the step 13 - 9 = 4 was provided, and it is confirmed as correct (since the feedback says "Step 1: 13 - 9 = 4"), we now evaluate potential formulas with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n**Note:** The user asked to label formulas with the left numbers from each step.

Since only one 4 is left, this is invalid.\n\n3. 5 * 6 - 6 = 24?

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

Same as above, 30 - 4 = 26, no.\n\n  - 6 * 4 + 5? 24 + 5 = 29, no.\n\n  - 6 * 4 - 5? 24 - 5 = 19, no.\n\n- Alternatively, using 5 and 6:\n\n  - 6 * 5 = 30, minus 4? 30 - 4 = 26, no.\n\n- Or, combining 4 and 5:\n\n  - 4 + 5 = 9, 9 * 2.67? No, as 2.67 is not an integer.\n\nGiven these options, the only straightforward way to reach 24 from 4, 5, and 6 is:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, with 5 remaining unused, which is acceptable if the goal is to reach 24 with the numbers used appropriately.\n\nSince the task is to reach exactly 24 using all numbers, we need to consider whether the leftover number (5) is acceptable or not.\n\nIn the standard 24 game, all four numbers must be used exactly once to reach 24.\n\nIn the initial step, only 13 - 9 = 4 is performed, reducing the set from {5, 6, 9, 13} to {4, 5, 6}.\n\nAssuming the next step is to use all remaining numbers to reach 24, then the formula must involve 4, 5, 6 with all used once.\n\nLet\'s test possible formulas:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, leftover 5, but 5 isn\'t used.\n\n- Try to use 5: 5 * 4 = 20, then 20 + 6? No, 20 + 6 = 26.\n\n- 5 + 6 + 4 = 15, no.\n\n- 6 * 5 = 30, 30 - 6? No, that’s 24, but we\'ve already used 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to combine the numbers differently.\n\nGiven the initial step, and assuming the goal is to reach 24 with the current left numbers, the key is whether the formula:\n\n**"4 * 6 = 24"** is valid, with remaining number 5.\n\nSince only 4 and 6 are used here, and 5 remains unused, but if the question is whether the formula is correct and can lead to 24, then:\n\n- The formula: 6 * 4 = 24 (left: 5)\n\n- Is this formula correct? Yes, 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n- Is it legal? Yes, multiplication of two numbers.\n\n- Does it lead to 24? Yes.\n\n- Are we using all numbers? No, because 5 remains unused, but the question is about the correctness of the formula and whether it can lead to 24, not necessarily using all numbers at each step.\n\nGiven that, the label for the formula:\n\n**"6 * 4"** (left: 5): **sure**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**"6 * 4"**', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt step by step.\n\nGiven initial numbers: 5, 6, 9, 13\n\nStep 1: 13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4, 5, 6)\n\nFrom this step, the left numbers are 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, considering the feedback, we need to evaluate formulas involving these left numbers (4, 5, 6) to reach 24.\n\nSince only the step 13 - 9 = 4 was provided, and it is confirmed as correct (since the feedback says "Step 1: 13 - 9 = 4"), we now evaluate potential formulas with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n**Note:** The user asked to label formulas with the left numbers from each step.

This is a valid formula.\n\n2. 5 * 4 + 4 = 24? No, 5 * 4 = 20, 20 + 4 = 24, but we only have 4, 5, 6 left, so adding another 4 again is not possible unless we use 4 twice. Since only one 4 is left, this is invalid.\n\n3. 5 * 6 - 6 = 24? No, 5 * 6 = 30, 30 - 6 = 24, but again, only one 6 is left, so subtracting 6 once is valid, but we need to check if the operation is legal.\n\nActually, in standard 24 game rules, each number can be used once unless specified otherwise. Since only one 6 is left, subtracting 6 once is valid.\n\n- 5 * 6 - 6 = 24 (left: 4, 5, 6): **sure**  \n   Explanation: 5 * 6 = 30; 30 - 6 = 24. Valid and leads to 24.\n\n4. 6 + 6 + 4 + 4?

No, as 1 isn\'t in remaining numbers.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 5): This is promising if we combine 4 and 6 directly.\n\nBut since the remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, and we want to reach 24 using all, the typical approach is to find an expression involving these three numbers.\n\nLet\'s check if the following is possible:\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24, remaining number 5; so, after using 6 and 4, we get 24, but 5 remains unused.\n\n- To include 5, consider:\n\n  - 5 * 4 + 6?

But 13 was used in first step.\n\nSince only 4, 5, 6 are left, and no other combinations lead to 24, the only candidate is 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n---\n\n**Final output:**\n\n**Formula:** 6 * 4 = 24 (left: 4, 5, 6): impossible\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24 (left: 4, 5, 6): impossible\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to analyze other potential formulas or steps!", "Let's analyze the provided step:\n\nStep 1: 5 + 6 = 11 (left: 9 11 13)\n\n- The formula: 5 + 6 = 11\n- Left numbers after this step: 9, 11, 13\n\nNow, consider whether this step is correct and can lead to 24:\n\n- The operation 5 + 6 = 11 is valid.\n- The remaining numbers are 9, 11, and 13.\n\nSince the feedback indicates this step is part of an attempt, but the key point is whether the resulting left numbers can lead to 24.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The original numbers are 5, 6, 9, 13.\n- After the first step, the remaining numbers are 9, 11, 13, which is correct as per the provided step.\n\nBased on this, the formula itself is correct and legal, and the left numbers are consistent.\n\n**Therefore, the label is 'sure'**.\n\nFinal output:\n\n**5 + 6 = 11 (left: 9 11 13): sure**", 'Let\'s analyze the given formula step by step:\n\nOriginal attempt:  \n\'Step 1: 5 + 6 = 11 (left: 9 11 13)\'\n\nFrom the feedback, the left numbers after this step are: 9, 11, 13.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether this step is correct and whether it can lead to 24.\n\n- The formula "5 + 6 = 11" is correct, and the resulting left numbers are 9, 11, 13, which matches the feedback.\n\nNext, considering the goal of reaching 24, we need to check if combining the remaining numbers (9, 11, 13) can produce 24.\n\nBut the instruction is to label the formula with the left numbers from each step as \'sure\' if correct and can lead to 24, or \'impossible\' otherwise.\n\nSince the initial step is correct, and the resulting left numbers are accurate, the initial formula is correct.\n\nHowever, the question is whether this specific step can lead to 24 in subsequent moves.\n\nWithout further steps, we cannot definitively say that this particular move leads to 24.
