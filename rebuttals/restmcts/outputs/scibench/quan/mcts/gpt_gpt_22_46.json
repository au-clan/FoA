Substituting this mass value back into the expression for velocity $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}$, we get $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 23.0}{2}} = \\sqrt{23.0}$.  Since the electron is confined to the well, the total energy $E$ can be expressed as $E = V + K = V + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.

Now, we have the kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 3.00 \\mathrm{eV}$.  The width of the well can be determined by considering the electron's motion in the well. The electron behaves like a wave inside the well, and the width can be related to the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. The de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the particle. Since $p = mv$, we can rewrite the wavelength as $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}$.  Now, we know that the momentum $p$ of the electron is related to its kinetic energy $K$ by $p = \\sqrt{2mK}$. Substituting this expression into the de Broglie wavelength formula, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mK}} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 2 \\times 3.00}}$. Simplifying this expression will give us the width of the rectangular well in nanometers.\n",
