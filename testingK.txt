value_outputs:  ["To reach 24 using the number 2, we can consider the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nOne possible step is to use multiplication since 2 is a prime factor of 24 (24 = 2^3 * 3). However, with only one 2, we cannot directly multiply to get 24.\n\nAnother approach is to consider if we can get closer to 24 by combining operations. For instance, if we had more than one 2, we could try squaring or multiplying in combinations to approach 24.\n\nGiven just the number 2 and aiming for 24, without additional numbers or a clear path to combine operations to reach exactly 24, the feasibility seems low.\n\nHowever, considering the constraint that we're evaluating the potential to reach 24 with the given number(s) and the operations allowed (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and without a clear combination that yields 24 exactly with just '2', we must conclude based on the information provided.\n\nThe final answer is: impossible"]
