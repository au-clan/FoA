We effectively say, \"Yes, the force varies over any given tiny little displacement, but the variation is so small we can approximate the force as being constant during the displacement.\" Sure, it is not precise, but if we make the displacements infinitesimal, then our error becomes infinitesimal and the result becomes precise.

Since the electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law as $E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}$, where $k$ is the electrostatic constant, $Q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge, you need to calculate the electric field magnitude at the center of the cube using the given charge of $1.8 \\mu C$ and the distance from the center to one face of the cube.\nStep 4: Calculate the electric field magnitude at the center of the cube using Coulomb's law. The distance from the center of the cube to one face is half of the edge length, so $r = \\frac{55 \\mathrm{~cm}}{2} = 27.5 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.275 \\mathrm{~m}$.
