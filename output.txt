summary prompt:  The game of 24 is a math puzzle where players use four numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to make the result equal to 24. Following is a previous attempt at solving the puzzle.

You made the following list of reflections:

Step 1 : Stepping
reflexion in step:  ['The main issues are invalid or irrelevant operations that do not systematically combine the original numbers to reach 24, leading away from the target and making the sequence invalid.']
