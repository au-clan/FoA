The puzzle requires combining the original four numbers with +, -, *, /, not forming equalities.\n\n2. Inconsistent handling: The solution treats the intermediate results as separate numbers, but it doesn't follow the rules of the game, which require combining the original numbers step-by-step to reach 24, not just performing standalone calculations.\n\n3. No attempt to reach 24: The steps do not attempt to produce 24 explicitly; instead, they produce intermediate totals that do not lead to 24, indicating the approach was not focused on solving the puzzle.\n\nOverall, the solution is invalid because it misapplies the rules and fails to systematically combine the initial numbers toward 24.",
