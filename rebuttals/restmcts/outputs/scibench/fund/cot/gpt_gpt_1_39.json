    "solution": "1. First, we need to calculate the number of hydrogen atoms in 250 cm^3 of water. Since water has a chemical formula of H2O, this means there are two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom.\n\n2. The molar volume of water is approximately 18 cm^3/mol. This means that 1 mole of water occupies 18 cm^3 of space.\n\n3. The molar mass of water is approximately 18 g/mol. This means that 1 mole of water weighs 18 grams.\n\n4. The molar mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 g/mol. This means that 1 mole of hydrogen weighs 1 gram.\n\n5. Since there are 2 hydrogen atoms in each water molecule, this means that there are 2 moles of hydrogen atoms for every 1 mole of water.\n\n6. Using the information above, we can calculate the number of moles of hydrogen atoms in 250 cm^3 of water by dividing the volume of water by the molar volume of water (250 cm^3 / 18 cm^3/mol = 13.89 moles).\n\n7.

Since each proton carries a charge of +1.6 x 10^-19 C, we can calculate the total positive charge in 250 cm^3 of water by multiplying the number of protons by the charge of each proton (1.67 x 10^25 protons * 1.6 x 10^-19 C/proton = 2.67 x 10^6 C).\n\n10.
