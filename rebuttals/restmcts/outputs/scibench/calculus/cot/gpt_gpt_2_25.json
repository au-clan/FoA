The formula for work done by a variable force $F(x)$ over a distance $dx$ is given by $dW = F(x)dx$.\n\n2. In this case, the force function is $F(x) = 5x^{-2}$ pounds, and the object moves from $x=1$ ft to $x=10$ ft. We need to integrate $F(x)$ from $x=1$ to $x=10$.\n\n3.

    "solution": "1. Let's denote:\n- $I(t)$ as the number of infected people at time $t$ (in days)\n- $S(t)$ as the number of susceptible (uninfected) people at time $t$\n- $N$ as the total population (5000 in this case)\n\n2. According to the model given, the rate of spread of the disease is jointly proportional to the number of infected and uninfected people. This can be expressed as:\n$\\frac{dI}{dt} = k \\cdot I \\cdot S$\n\n3. We know that at the beginning of the week, 160 people are infected, so $I(0) = 160$. We also know that at the end of the week, 1200 people are infected, so $I(7) = 1200$. Since $I(t)$ represents the number of infected people at time $t$, we can assume that $I(t)$ is a continuous function.\n\n4. We are looking for the time it takes for 80% of the population to become infected, i.e., when $I(t) = 0.8N = 0.8 \\cdot 5000 = 4000$. So, we need to find the time $t$ when $I(t) = 4000$.\n\n5. To solve the differential equation $\\frac{dI}{dt} = k \\cdot I \\cdot S$, we need to express $S$ in terms of $I$. Since $S = N - I$, we have $\\frac{dI}{dt} = k \\cdot I \\cdot (N - I)$.\n\n6. We can solve this differential equation to find the function $I(t)$. Once we have $I(t)$, we can find the time $t$ when $I(t) = 4000$.\n\n7. Finally, the time it takes for 80% of the population to become infected is the value of $t$ we found in step 6, and the unit of the answer should be in days.\n\nBy following these steps and solving the differential equation, we can determine how long it will take for 80% of the population in the isolated town to become infected.",

Since the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse lying along the base, the height of each triangle will be equal to the radius of the base, which is 3.\n\n3. The volume of each isosceles right triangle can be calculated using the formula V = (1/2) * base * height, where the base is the side length of the triangle and the height is the radius of the base.\n\n4. The side length of the triangle (hypotenuse) is the diameter of the base, which is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n5. Plugging in the values, we get V = (1/2) * 6 * 3 = 9 for each triangle.\n\n6. Since the cross-sections are parallel and perpendicular to the base, we can integrate the volume of each triangle over the entire base to find the total volume of the solid.\n\n7.
