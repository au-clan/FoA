The characteristic equation for the differential equation $9y'' + 12y' + 4y = 0$ is $9r^2 + 12r + 4 = 0$.   Solving this quadratic equation, we get $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{12^2 - 4*9*4}}{2*9} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 144}}{18} = \\frac{-12}{18} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.  Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is $y(t) = c_1e^{-\\frac{2}{3}t} + c_2te^{-\\frac{2}{3}t}$.\n",
