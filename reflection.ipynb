      "This mistake can be generalized as a failure to consider the long-term implications of each operation. To avoid similar mistakes, players should evaluate each potential operation based on its likelihood of leading to the target result of 24, rather than simply performing operations without a clear strategy. \n",

This mistake can be avoided by considering all possible combinations of operations and numbers from the start, rather than progressing step-by-step with a fixed sequence. A more effective approach would be to explore multiple paths simultaneously, allowing for backtracking and adjustment of operations to reach the target result of 24. This highlights the importance of considering all possible permutations and combinations in math puzzles like the game of 24.\n"

The main mistake is the repeated exploration of the same operations with numbers that are not in the original input list, such as 2, 3, 8, and 12. This leads to a significant amount of redundant calculations and ignores the fact that these numbers are not available for use.\n",

This leads to subsequent operations that do not utilize the original numbers effectively, ultimately failing to reach the target result of 24.\n",
