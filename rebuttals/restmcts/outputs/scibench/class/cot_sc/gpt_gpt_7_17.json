Substituting $u_2 = \\alpha u_1$ into the conservation of kinetic energy equation:\n$1/2 m_1 u_1^2 = 1/2 m_2 (\\alpha u_1)^2$\n$1/2 m_1 u_1^2 = 1/2 m_2 \\alpha^2 u_1^2$\n$m_1 = m_2 \\alpha^2$\n\n4. Substituting $m_1 = m_2 \\alpha^2$ into the conservation of momentum equation:\n$m_1 u_1 + m_2 \\alpha u_1 = 0$\n$m_1 u_1 + m_1 u_1 = 0$\n$2m_1 u_1 = 0$\n$u_1 = 0$\n\n5. Since $u_1 = 0$, we need to find the conditions on $\\alpha$ such that $\\alpha$ is positive:\nFrom $m_1 = m_2 \\alpha^2$, we know that $\\alpha$ must be positive in order for $m_1$ to be at rest after the collision.\n\nTherefore, the conditions on $u_1 / u_2$ such that $m_1$ is at rest after the collision and $\\alpha$ is positive are:\n$u_1 = 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$.",

    "content": "Astronaut Stumblebum wanders too far away from the space shuttle orbiter while repairing a broken communications satellite. Stumblebum realizes that the orbiter is moving away from him at $3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Stumblebum and his maneuvering unit have a mass of $100 \\mathrm{~kg}$, including a pressurized tank of mass $10 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The tank includes only $2 \\mathrm{~kg}$ of gas that is used to propel him in space. The gas escapes with a constant velocity of $100 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. With what velocity will Stumblebum have to throw the empty tank away to reach the orbiter? The unit of the answer should be $ \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ .",
    "solution": "1. Calculate the initial momentum of Stumblebum and his maneuvering unit before he throws away the tank. \n\nInitial momentum = (mass of Stumblebum + mass of tank) * velocity of Stumblebum\n\nInitial momentum = (100 kg + 10 kg) * 3 m/s\nInitial momentum = 330 kg*m/s\n\n2. Calculate the final momentum of Stumblebum and his maneuvering unit after he throws away the tank and the gas escapes. \n\nFinal momentum = mass of Stumblebum * final velocity of Stumblebum + mass of gas * velocity of gas\n\nFinal momentum = 100 kg * Vf + 2 kg * 100 m/s\n\n3. Since momentum is conserved, the initial momentum should be equal to the final momentum. Therefore, we can set up an equation:\n\nInitial momentum = Final momentum\n330 = 100 * Vf + 2 * 100\n\n4. Solve for Vf:\n\n330 = 100Vf + 200\n100Vf = 130\nVf = 1.3 m/s\n\nTherefore, Stumblebum will have to throw the empty tank away with a velocity of 1.3 m/s to reach the orbiter.",
