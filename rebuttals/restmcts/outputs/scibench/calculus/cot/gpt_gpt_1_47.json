    "solution": "1. First, we need to calculate the outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ to the surface of the cylinder $x^2+y^2=4$. Since the surface is a cylinder aligned with the $z$-axis, the normal vector will simply be $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{k}$.\n\n2. The outward flux of the fluid through the surface is given by the surface integral of the dot product of the velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$ and the outward normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ over the surface of the cylinder. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$\\Phi = \\iint_S \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS$\n\n3. Since the surface of the cylinder is defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 4$, we can write $x = 2\\cos\\theta$ and $y = 2\\sin\\theta$ in polar coordinates.

    "content": "A planning engineer for a new alum plant must present some estimates to his company regarding the capacity of a silo designed to contain bauxite ore until it is processed into alum.

How long does it take for $80 \\%$ of the population to become infected? The unit of the answer should be  $\\mathrm{days}$.",
    "solution": "1. Let $I(t)$ be the number of infected people at time $t$ (in days), and let $S(t)$ be the number of susceptible (uninfected) people at time $t$. We are given that $I(0) = 160$ and $I(7) = 1200$.\n\n2. According to the model, the rate of spread is jointly proportional to the number of infected and uninfected people. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = kI(t)S(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3. Since the total population is constant, we have $S(t) = 5000 - I(t)$.\n\n4. We can rewrite the differential equation as:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = kI(t)(5000 - I(t))$$\n\n5. We can solve this differential equation to find $I(t)$, but since we are interested in when $80 \\%$ of the population is infected, we can set $I(t) = 0.8 \\times 5000 = 4000$.\n\n6. Now, we can solve the equation:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = kI(t)(5000 - I(t))$$\n$$\\frac{dI}{4000(5000 - 4000)} = kdt$$\n$$\\frac{dI}{4000(1000)} = kdt$$\n$$\\frac{dI}{4000000} = kdt$$\n\n7. Integrating both sides gives:\n$$\\int_{160}^{1200} \\frac{1}{4000000} dI = \\int_{0}^{t} k dt$$\n$$\\frac{1200-160}{4000000} = kt$$\n$$\\frac{1040}{4000000} = kt$$\n$$t = \\frac{1040}{4000000k}$$\n\n8.

The volume of the solid can be found by integrating the area of each cross-section over the entire length of the solid.
