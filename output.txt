reflexion in step:  ['The main mistakes are:\n\n1. The initial step "2 + 2 = 4" is valid, but the subsequent steps are invalid because they do not proceed logically with the remaining numbers. After combining 2+2=4, the left numbers should be 3, 4, 5, but the solution attempts "3 + 5 = 8" (valid), leaving 4 and 8, which is fine so far. \n\n2. However, the step "4 * 8 = 32" is correct, but then "32 / 1 = 32" introduces a division by 1, which is unnecessary and does not help reach 24. \n\n3. The main issue is that the sequence does not combine the remaining numbers to reach 24 directly, and the steps do not logically progress towards 24. Instead, they produce a large number (32) that is further away from 24, indicating the approach is invalid for solving the puzzle as intended.\n\nIn summary, the errors include attempting to manipulate numbers without a clear path to 24 and performing unnecessary operations that do not simplify toward the target.']
