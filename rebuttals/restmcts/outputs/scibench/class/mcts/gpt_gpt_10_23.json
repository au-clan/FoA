The initial momentum of the system is equal to the final momentum after Stumblebum throws away the tank and gas.

Next, we need to apply the conservation of momentum to find the velocity at which Stumblebum must throw the empty tank to reach the orbiter. The initial momentum of the system (Stumblebum + tank) is 0 since they are initially stationary.
