value_outputs:  ["Based on the previous feedback, the pair (1, 8) was not explicitly listed as impossible. Let's evaluate whether 1 and 8 can reach 24 using basic operations:\n\nPossible operations:\n- Addition: 1 + 8 = 9\n- Subtraction: 8 - 1 = 7\n- Multiplication: 1 * 8 = 8\n- Division: 8 / 1 = 8\n\nNone of these directly give 24. Let's consider combining multiple steps:\n\n- (8 - 1) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21 (close but not 24)\n- (8 + 1) * 2 = 9 * 2 = 18\n- 8 * 3 = 24 (but 3 is not given)\n- 8 * 4 = 32 (no)\n- 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 (but only one 8 is given)\n\nSince only 1 and 8 are given, and no other numbers, and straightforward operations do not reach 24, and no combination of 1 and 8 alone can produce 24, the conclusion is:\n\nimpossible\n\n**Final answer:**\nimpossible"]
