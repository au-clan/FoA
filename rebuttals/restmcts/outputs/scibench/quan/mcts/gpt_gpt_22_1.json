Since the proton is a point particle, we can consider it to be a sphere with all its mass concentrated at its center. The moment of inertia for a sphere is given by I = (2/5)mr^2, where m is the mass of the proton and r is the radius of the proton. The angular velocity of a spinning proton is equal to its spin frequency multiplied by 2π. Thus, the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of a proton can be calculated using the formula L = (2/5)mr^2 * 2πf, where f is the spin frequency of the proton. We can then substitute the known values for the mass of a proton (m = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg) and the radius of a proton (r = 8.8 x 10^-16 m) to calculate the numerical value of the spin angular momentum.\n",
