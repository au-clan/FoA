But earlier, the initial step claimed is impossible to lead to 24, which suggests that the initial step is invalid or does not lead to a solution.\n\nHence, the formulas with the left numbers:\n\n- 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible (as per feedback)\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure (can lead to 24)\n\nFinal output:\n\n1. 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible  \n2. 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure", 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt:\n\nOriginal attempt:  \n[\'Step 1: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1)\']\n\nThe issue:  \n- The operation uses 4 and 6, which are part of the initial set, so that\'s valid.  \n- After this step, the remaining numbers should be the original ones minus the used ones, i.e., 1, 1, and 4 (since 6 and 4 are used).  \n- But the feedback indicates that the "left" numbers are 1 and 1, which is incorrect because 4 was used in the operation, but it remains in the pool.  \n- The feedback states that this step is illegal because the left numbers do not match the previous step\'s remaining numbers or the operation is invalid.\n\nGiven that, let\'s reconstruct the process:\n\n- Initial numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n- After using 4 and 6 to get 24, remaining should be 1 and 1.\n- But in the attempt, the "left" numbers after step 1 are shown as 1 and 1, which is consistent with the remaining numbers after using 4 and 6.\n\nHowever, the feedback says the step is illegal, which suggests that the actual issue is that the attempt to get 24 using 4 * 6 is valid, but the problem is that the "left" numbers are not accurately represented or the operation is considered invalid due to the game rules.\n\n**Important note:**  \nIn the game, each operation should use exactly two numbers from the current set, and the result replaces those two numbers, reducing the count by one each time.\n\nIn the attempt, they used 4 * 6 = 24, replacing 4 and 6 with 24, leaving 1, 1, 24. But the "left" numbers are shown as 1 1, which indicates that they did not include the 24 in the remaining numbers.\n\nThus, the step is invalid because the remaining numbers after the operation should be 1, 1, and 24, not just 1 and 1.\n\n**Given this, now let\'s produce the labels:**\n\n---\n\n**Reconstructed formula with left numbers:**\n\n- Step 1: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1)\n\n**Label:** impossible\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```plaintext\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1): impossible\n```', "Let's analyze each step carefully based on the original problem and the feedback.\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\n**Step 1:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24)  \n- This is correct and uses original numbers 4 and 6 to produce 24.  \n- Remaining numbers: 1, 1, 24\n\n**Step 2:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24)  \n- This is correct; dividing 24 by 1 gives 24.  \n- Remaining numbers: 1, 24\n\n**Step 3:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24)  \n- This is correct; dividing 24 by 1 gives 24.  \n- Remaining number: 24\n\n**Step 4:** answer: 4 * 6 = 24  \n- The formula is simply 4 * 6, which is the initial step, but the feedback notes that the numbers used are not from the current remaining numbers, and the original numbers are no longer available as 4 and 6.  \n- Since the previous steps have already consumed 4 and 6, and the remaining number is 24, trying to revert back to 4 * 6 does not follow the sequence of operations or the current available numbers.  \n- Therefore, this step is invalid in the current context.\n\nNow, labeling each:\n\n- **Step 1:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24): sure  \n- **Step 2:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24): sure  \n- **Step 3:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24): sure  \n- **Step 4:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24): impossible\n\n**Final output:**\n\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24): sure  \n24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24): sure  \n24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24): sure  \n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt and feedback:\n\n- The attempted answer: "24 / 1 = 24"\n- Feedback indicates that the numbers used are not from the original set (1, 1, 4, 6).\n\nSince the attempt uses only the number 1 (from the original set) and the result 24, but the feedback suggests the actual numbers used are different, the formula is not valid based on the original numbers.\n\nNow, considering "left numbers from each step," it appears the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6.

No, because 2 is already used, and we only have 2, 4, and 6 remaining.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 → this is promising.\n\nSince 4 * 6 = 24, and we have only 2 left, but we can't use 2 now because the goal is to reach 24 with remaining numbers. But wait, the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6, and after the first operation, we get left: 2, 4, 6. \n\nLet's consider whether the remaining steps can yield 24:\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24, and then the remaining 2 can be used to adjust the total if needed, but the goal is to reach 24, which we've achieved with 4 * 6.\n\nTherefore, the formula:\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2)\n\nThis is a valid step. But earlier, the initial step claimed is impossible to lead to 24, which suggests that the initial step is invalid or does not lead to a solution.\n\nHence, the formulas with the left numbers:\n\n- 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible (as per feedback)\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure (can lead to 24)\n\nFinal output:\n\n1. 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible  \n2. 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure", 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt:\n\nOriginal attempt:  \n[\'Step 1: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1)\']\n\nThe issue:  \n- The operation uses 4 and 6, which are part of the initial set, so that\'s valid.  \n- After this step, the remaining numbers should be the original ones minus the used ones, i.e., 1, 1, and 4 (since 6 and 4 are used).  \n- But the feedback indicates that the "left" numbers are 1 and 1, which is incorrect because 4 was used in the operation, but it remains in the pool.  \n- The feedback states that this step is illegal because the left numbers do not match the previous step\'s remaining numbers or the operation is invalid.\n\nGiven that, let\'s reconstruct the process:\n\n- Initial numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n- After using 4 and 6 to get 24, remaining should be 1 and 1.\n- But in the attempt, the "left" numbers after step 1 are shown as 1 and 1, which is consistent with the remaining numbers after using 4 and 6.\n\nHowever, the feedback says the step is illegal, which suggests that the actual issue is that the attempt to get 24 using 4 * 6 is valid, but the problem is that the "left" numbers are not accurately represented or the operation is considered invalid due to the game rules.\n\n**Important note:**  \nIn the game, each operation should use exactly two numbers from the current set, and the result replaces those two numbers, reducing the count by one each time.\n\nIn the attempt, they used 4 * 6 = 24, replacing 4 and 6 with 24, leaving 1, 1, 24.

self.reflects:  ["Let's analyze the provided step and the initial numbers:\n\nInitial numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6  \nStep 1 formula: 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6)  \n\nAccording to the feedback, this step is impossible to lead to 24, meaning that starting with 2, 4, 6 cannot eventually give 24 through valid operations.\n\nNow, for the remaining numbers, the formulas and labels:\n\n1. Using the left numbers after Step 1: 2, 4, 6\n\nPossible formulas:\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 → cannot reach 24 directly, but is it possible? Let's check.\n- 2 * 6 = 12, then 12 * 2 = 24? No, because 2 is already used, and we only have 2, 4, and 6 remaining.\n- 4 * 6 = 24 → this is promising.\n\nSince 4 * 6 = 24, and we have only 2 left, but we can't use 2 now because the goal is to reach 24 with remaining numbers. But wait, the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6, and after the first operation, we get left: 2, 4, 6. \n\nLet's consider whether the remaining steps can yield 24:\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24, and then the remaining 2 can be used to adjust the total if needed, but the goal is to reach 24, which we've achieved with 4 * 6.\n\nTherefore, the formula:\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2)\n\nThis is a valid step. But earlier, the initial step claimed is impossible to lead to 24, which suggests that the initial step is invalid or does not lead to a solution.\n\nHence, the formulas with the left numbers:\n\n- 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible (as per feedback)\n- 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure (can lead to 24)\n\nFinal output:\n\n1. 1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2, 4, 6): impossible  \n2. 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2): sure", 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt:\n\nOriginal attempt:  \n[\'Step 1: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1)\']\n\nThe issue:  \n- The operation uses 4 and 6, which are part of the initial set, so that\'s valid.  \n- After this step, the remaining numbers should be the original ones minus the used ones, i.e., 1, 1, and 4 (since 6 and 4 are used).  \n- But the feedback indicates that the "left" numbers are 1 and 1, which is incorrect because 4 was used in the operation, but it remains in the pool.  \n- The feedback states that this step is illegal because the left numbers do not match the previous step\'s remaining numbers or the operation is invalid.\n\nGiven that, let\'s reconstruct the process:\n\n- Initial numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n- After using 4 and 6 to get 24, remaining should be 1 and 1.\n- But in the attempt, the "left" numbers after step 1 are shown as 1 and 1, which is consistent with the remaining numbers after using 4 and 6.\n\nHowever, the feedback says the step is illegal, which suggests that the actual issue is that the attempt to get 24 using 4 * 6 is valid, but the problem is that the "left" numbers are not accurately represented or the operation is considered invalid due to the game rules.\n\n**Important note:**  \nIn the game, each operation should use exactly two numbers from the current set, and the result replaces those two numbers, reducing the count by one each time.\n\nIn the attempt, they used 4 * 6 = 24, replacing 4 and 6 with 24, leaving 1, 1, 24. But the "left" numbers are shown as 1 1, which indicates that they did not include the 24 in the remaining numbers.\n\nThus, the step is invalid because the remaining numbers after the operation should be 1, 1, and 24, not just 1 and 1.\n\n**Given this, now let\'s produce the labels:**\n\n---\n\n**Reconstructed formula with left numbers:**\n\n- Step 1: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1)\n\n**Label:** impossible\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```plaintext\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1): impossible\n```', "Let's analyze each step carefully based on the original problem and the feedback.\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\n**Step 1:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24)  \n- This is correct and uses original numbers 4 and 6 to produce 24.  \n- Remaining numbers: 1, 1, 24\n\n**Step 2:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24)  \n- This is correct; dividing 24 by 1 gives 24.  \n- Remaining numbers: 1, 24\n\n**Step 3:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24)  \n- This is correct; dividing 24 by 1 gives 24.  \n- Remaining number: 24\n\n**Step 4:** answer: 4 * 6 = 24  \n- The formula is simply 4 * 6, which is the initial step, but the feedback notes that the numbers used are not from the current remaining numbers, and the original numbers are no longer available as 4 and 6.  \n- Since the previous steps have already consumed 4 and 6, and the remaining number is 24, trying to revert back to 4 * 6 does not follow the sequence of operations or the current available numbers.  \n- Therefore, this step is invalid in the current context.\n\nNow, labeling each:\n\n- **Step 1:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24): sure  \n- **Step 2:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24): sure  \n- **Step 3:** 24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24): sure  \n- **Step 4:** 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24): impossible\n\n**Final output:**\n\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1 1 24): sure  \n24 / 1 = 24 (left: 1 24): sure  \n24 / 1 = 24 (left: 24): sure  \n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt and feedback:\n\n- The attempted answer: "24 / 1 = 24"\n- Feedback indicates that the numbers used are not from the original set (1, 1, 4, 6).\n\nSince the attempt uses only the number 1 (from the original set) and the result 24, but the feedback suggests the actual numbers used are different, the formula is not valid based on the original numbers.\n\nNow, considering "left numbers from each step," it appears the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6.

The formula:\n\n**(4 * 6) = 24** (left: 1, 1, 24): **sure**\n\nBecause, as a standalone, this formula is correct and can lead to 24 if the remaining numbers are used appropriately afterward.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(4 * 6) = 24 (left: 1, 1, 24): sure", "Let's analyze the provided attempt:\n\nThe original numbers are: 1, 1, 4, 6.\n\nThe answer given is: 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nHowever, the feedback states that the attempt is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. \n\nIn the context of the game, after performing operations, the remaining numbers (left numbers) should be consistent with the original set, possibly after previous steps.\n\nSince the attempt only shows a final step and the feedback indicates the numbers used are not from the original set, this suggests that at this point, the left numbers are not valid or do not correspond to the original set.\n\nNow, let's assume the left numbers at this step are the original set, i.e., 1, 1, 4, 6.\n\n- The formula: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1, 4, 6)\n\nGiven the feedback, this formula is **incorrect** because it does not use the original numbers properly or is not a valid step in the process (it appears to directly multiply 4 and 6, ignoring the two 1's).\n\nThus, the label for this formula with the original left numbers:\n\n**4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible**\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible", "Let's analyze the provided information.\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nThe attempted answer was: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback indicates that the attempt did not use the original numbers properly, implying the original numbers were not correctly used or were altered.\n\nNow, considering the formulas with left numbers from each step, but since only one step was given, and it was incorrect, I will analyze the scenario assuming the initial step.\n\nGiven the original numbers, potential steps could be:\n\n- Using 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24 (but original numbers include 1 and 1, which are not used here; so, unless the other 1s are still available, the step is invalid)\n\n- Since the initial step only used 4 and 6, and the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6, after this operation, the remaining numbers would be 1, 1, and 24 (which is not a number to continue with).\n\nGiven the feedback, the key point is that the previous formula did not use the original numbers correctly.\n\n**Therefore, the formula with left numbers from the initial step:**\n\n`4 * 6 = 24` (left: 1, 1, 4, 6)\n\n**Label:** impossible\n\nBecause the operation used only 4 and 6, ignoring the original numbers 1 and 1, which violates the rules.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n`4 * 6 = 24` (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the attempt:\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nStep 4: answer: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nIn the feedback, it\'s noted that the attempt is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. Specifically, the attempt uses 4 and 6, which are indeed in the original set, but it does not specify which numbers are left after this step. \n\nSince the feedback indicates that the previous step\'s use of numbers is invalid (possibly because they have already been used or because the sequence is not consistent with the original numbers), the main issue is whether this formula is valid and leads to 24.\n\nGiven the original numbers, a correct sequence to reach 24 is possible, but this particular step alone (multiplying 4 * 6) is valid in isolation, but the previous steps and the context matter.\n\nHowever, since the feedback explicitly states that the answer uses numbers not from the original set, we must classify this as:\n\n- The formula "4 * 6" is valid mathematically and can lead to 24, but since the feedback says the used numbers are not from the original set (which they are), this might be more about the sequence of steps.\n\nGiven the instructions, the labels are based on whether the formula is correct and can lead to 24, considering the numbers left at that point.\n\nIn this context, because the feedback says the attempt is incorrect due to using numbers not from the original set, we should mark this as:\n\n{4 * 6} (left: 1, 1): impossible\n\nBecause after this step, the remaining numbers would be inconsistent with the original set, or the attempt is invalid.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n4 * 6 (left: 1, 1): impossible', 'Let\'s analyze the attempt and the feedback:\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6  \nAttempted step: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," which indicates that in the actual sequence of steps, the numbers used earlier are different or have been altered.\n\nSince only this step is provided, and the feedback invalidates the use of 4 and 6 directly from the original set, any formula that uses these numbers directly from the initial set is considered **impossible**.\n\nNow, considering the left numbers from the step:\n\n- After the operation 4 * 6, the remaining numbers would be 1, 1, and 24 (assuming no other steps).

Specifically, the attempt used 4 and 6, which are both in the original set, but it did not account for the other numbers, and the total set of steps and remaining numbers are not provided here.\n\nSince the feedback indicates that the specific formula "4 * 6 = 24" is not valid in the context of the original numbers, and the attempt disregards the initial set, it is considered an illegal or incorrect move.\n\nNow, based on the instructions:\n\nRepeat the formula with the left numbers from each step:  \n- The formula: 4 * 6 = 24  \n- The left numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6 (original set, but after the move, the remaining numbers are 1, 1, and the result 24, which is not part of the original set)\n\nGiven the feedback, the move is invalid because it uses only two of the original numbers and ignores the others, and the move itself is not a valid step in the game starting from the original numbers.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible', 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt and the feedback:\n\nThe attempt was: 4 * 6 = 24  \nThe original numbers are: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nIn the attempt, the used numbers are 4 and 6, which are part of the original set, but the feedback states: "The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," indicating that the attempt is invalid because it does not use all four original numbers or uses numbers not available.\n\nNow, since the attempt only uses 4 and 6, and the rules of the game require using all four numbers exactly once, the formula is invalid.\n\nGiven that, the \'left numbers\' after this step would be the original set minus the used numbers (4 and 6), which leaves 1 and 1 unused.

Yes, since 4 and 6 are used, the remaining are 1 and 1.\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem." But in this case, they are from the original set.\n\n**Important note:** The feedback mentions that "Step 4" tried to give an answer but was incorrect because the numbers used were not the original set. Since 4 and 6 are indeed from the original set, the only way for the attempt to be invalid is if the step\'s process wasn\'t valid or if the numbers were not correctly tracked.\n\nGiven that, the key point is: the formula 4 * 6 uses numbers from the original set, and the remaining numbers are 1 and 1. The attempt is to reach 24, which is correct mathematically, but the feedback says it\'s incorrect because "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem"—which seems inconsistent because 4 and 6 are from the original set.\n\nAssuming the feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because the step did not follow the rules or process correctly, or perhaps because the operation was not performed properly with the initial set, then:\n\n- The formula 4 * 6 (left: 1, 1) is a valid operation, and it leads to 24.\n\n- Given the feedback, the conclusion is that the

because in the original set, we have two 1s, 4, and 6, but in the step, after previous operations, the remaining numbers are not specified. \n\nSince the feedback indicates that the formula uses

But in this case, they are from the original set.\n\n**Important note:** The feedback mentions that "Step 4" tried to give an answer but was incorrect because the numbers used were not the original set. Since 4 and 6 are indeed from the original set, the only way for the attempt to be invalid is if the step\'s process wasn\'t valid or if the numbers were not correctly tracked.\n\nGiven that, the key point is: the formula 4 * 6 uses numbers from the original set, and the remaining numbers are 1 and 1. The attempt is to reach 24, which is correct mathematically, but the feedback says it\'s incorrect because "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem"—which seems inconsistent because 4 and 6 are from the original set.\n\nAssuming the feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because the step did not follow the rules or process correctly, or perhaps because the operation was not performed properly with the initial set, then:\n\n- The formula 4 * 6 (left: 1, 1) is a valid operation, and it leads to 24.\n\n- Given the feedback, the conclusion is that the

because in the original set, we have two 1s, 4, and 6, but in the step, after previous operations, the remaining numbers are not specified. \n\nSince the feedback indicates that the formula uses numbers not available at that step, and the particular formula "4 * 6" directly uses 4 and 6 which are in the original set, but in the context of the previous operations, unless 4 and 6 are still

is invalid because the feedback says "the numbers you use are not the original numbers" — which might mean the attempt didn\'t properly track the original numbers, or perhaps the attempt didn\'t use

The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem."\n\nThis indicates that at the point of the attempted answer, the numbers used were not the original ones, or the step was invalid because it used numbers not available at that stage.\n\nGiven that, I will now evaluate the formula and the left numbers from each step, assuming the step was made with the original numbers:\n\n- The formula: 4 * 6 = 24  \n- The left numbers before this step: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nSince the formula uses 4 and 6, it is valid to use these numbers from the original set. The product is 24, which is correct, but the feedback indicates that the attempt was invalid because the numbers were not from the original set at that step, or the step was taken improperly.\n\nTherefore, the label for this formula with the left numbers {1, 1, 4, 6} is:\n\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible\n\nBecause the feedback explicitly says that the attempt used numbers not from the original set at that step, or was invalid.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible', 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt:\n\nThe attempt was: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nHowever, the original numbers are 1, 1, 4, 6.\n\nIn the feedback, it states that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. Specifically, the attempt used 4 and 6, which are both in the original set, but it did not account for the other numbers, and the total set of steps and remaining numbers are not provided here.\n\nSince the feedback indicates that the specific formula "4 * 6 = 24" is not valid in the context of the original numbers, and the attempt disregards the initial set, it is considered an illegal or incorrect move.\n\nNow, based on the instructions:\n\nRepeat the formula with the left numbers from each step:  \n- The formula: 4 * 6 = 24  \n- The left numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6 (original set, but after the move, the remaining numbers are 1, 1, and the result 24, which is not part of the original set)\n\nGiven the feedback, the move is invalid because it uses only two of the original numbers and ignores the others, and the move itself is not a valid step in the game starting from the original numbers.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): impossible', 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt and the feedback:\n\nThe attempt was: 4 * 6 = 24  \nThe original numbers are: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nIn the attempt, the used numbers are 4 and 6, which are part of the original set, but the feedback states: "The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," indicating that the attempt is invalid because it does not use all four original numbers or uses numbers not available.\n\nNow, since the attempt only uses 4 and 6, and the rules of the game require using all four numbers exactly once, the formula is invalid.\n\nGiven that, the \'left numbers\' after this step would be the original set minus the used numbers (4 and 6), which leaves 1 and 1 unused. But as per the game rules, to reach 24, we need to use all four numbers. Therefore, this formula is invalid.\n\n**Repeating the formula with left numbers:**\n\n- Used numbers: 4 and 6\n- Left numbers: 1, 1\n\n**Label:**\n\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1): impossible', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt:\n\nOriginal numbers: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nStep 4: answer: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nIn this step, the formula uses 4 and 6 to get 24.

Yes, since 4 and 6 are used, the remaining are 1 and 1.\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem." But in this case, they are from the original set.\n\n**Important note:** The feedback mentions that "Step 4" tried to give an answer but was incorrect because the numbers used were not the original set. Since 4 and 6 are indeed from the original set, the only way for the attempt to be invalid is if the step\'s process wasn\'t valid or if the numbers were not correctly tracked.\n\nGiven that, the key point is: the formula 4 * 6 uses numbers from the original set, and the remaining numbers are 1 and 1. The attempt is to reach 24, which is correct mathematically, but the feedback says it\'s incorrect because "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem"—which seems inconsistent because 4 and 6 are from the original set.\n\nAssuming the feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because the step did not follow the rules or process correctly, or perhaps because the operation was not performed properly with the initial set, then:\n\n- The formula 4 * 6 (left: 1, 1) is a valid operation, and it leads to 24.\n\n- Given the feedback, the conclusion is that the attempt is invalid (because the feedback says it\'s incorrect), so the label would be \'impossible\'.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n`4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1): impossible`', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt:\n\nThe original numbers are: 1, 1, 4, 6\n\nThe attempted formula in Step 4 is: 4 * 6 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback states that the numbers used are not from the original set, which is correct because in the original set, we have two 1s, 4, and 6, but in the step, after previous operations, the remaining numbers are not specified. \n\nSince the feedback indicates that the formula uses numbers not available at that step, and the particular formula "4 * 6" directly uses 4 and 6 which are in the original set, but in the context of the previous operations, unless 4 and 6 are still available, the formula may be invalid.\n\nGiven the previous step merely states the answer and not the intermediate steps, and the feedback explicitly states that the used numbers are not from the original set, the formula is invalid in the context of the game.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- The formula: 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1, 4, 6)\n\n- Since the feedback says the numbers used are not from the original, and the previous step\'s context indicates the numbers aren\'t available anymore, this formula is invalid.\n\n**Label:** impossible\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n4 * 6 = 24 (left: 1, 1, 4, 6):

and uses valid numbers.\n\nLabels:\n- The formula itself (4 * 6 = 24) is correct and uses original numbers, so it can lead to 24.\n\nTherefore:\n{4 * 6 = 24} (left: 1, 1, 4, 6): sure', "Let's analyze

is invalid because the feedback says "the numbers you use are not the original numbers" — which might mean the attempt didn\'t properly track the original numbers, or perhaps the attempt didn\'t use the numbers correctly.\n\nHowever, based on the request, let\'s evaluate each formula with the left numbers from each step.\n\n---\n\n**Formula:** 4 * 6 = 24  \n**Left numbers:** 1, 1 (after using 4

But the question asks to assign 'sure' or 'impossible' based on correctness and legality, not whether it actually yields 24.\n\nGiven that, the formula uses only numbers from the original set, and the operation is valid, and it indeed computes to 24: (7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24. So the formula does not produce 24.\n\nTherefore, the formula is mathematically valid but incorrect for producing 24.\n\nBased on the instructions, since the formula is valid but does not produce 24, it should be labeled as 'impossible' because it does not lead to 24.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible", "Let's analyze the given attempt:\n\nAttempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe left numbers from the original problem are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nIn the attempt, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8.\n\nRemaining number: Since only 7, 3, and 8 are used in the formula, and the original numbers include two 7s, the attempt appears to have used only one 7, which is inconsistent with the original set.\n\nAdditionally, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the formula is invalid in the context of the original numbers.\n\nNow, to evaluate the labels:\n\n- For the formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n  - Left numbers after this operation: Since we are using 7, 3, and 8, and assuming two 7s are available, but only one is used here, the remaining numbers would be the unused 7 and 8, or perhaps no number is left depending on the process.

The number 7 is used twice (once as the first 7, once as the second 7), but in the step, only one 7 is used to subtract 3, and then multiply by 8. \n\nHowever, the feedback indicates that the answer uses numbers not from the original set in the step (specifically, the attempt says "Step 4: answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24" but the previous step\'s left numbers are not specified here). \n\nGiven the original set {3, 7, 7, 8}, the operation (7 - 3) * 8 involves the numbers 7, 3, and 8, which are all present. The key issue is whether the formula uses each number exactly once and only from the original set. Here, 7 and 3 are used once each, and 8 once, which matches the original set.\n\nBut the feedback states: "Evaluation: Step 4 tries to give an answer but it is incorrect. The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem."\n\nThis suggests that in the previous step, the numbers used were altered or that the method of operation is invalid.\n\nSince the prompt asks to give labels based on whether the formula is correct and can lead to 24, and the attempted formula:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nevaluates correctly (since (7 - 3) = 4, and 4 * 8 = 32, which is NOT 24), the formula is mathematically incorrect to reach 24.\n\n**Therefore, the label is \'impossible\'.**\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nThe attempted formula was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLeft numbers after this step would have been: 7, 8 (since 7 and 3 were used).\n\nNow, evaluate the formula:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24. Also, the feedback states that the numbers used do not match the original set because the step used 7 and 3, which are from the original set, but the previous step's left numbers are not specified explicitly.\n\nHowever, given the context, the main issue is that the evaluation was incorrect (since it yields 32, not 24), and the feedback states the answer is incorrect.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8): impossible", 'The attempted formula is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLeft numbers from each step: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nSince the formula uses the numbers 7, 3, and 8, but the feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used do not match the original set, I will check if the formula is valid and uses only the original numbers.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Original numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n- Formula uses: 7, 3, 8.\n- The second 7 is not used in the formula, which is acceptable as long as the overall usage of numbers matches. But since the feedback states the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set, and the formula uses only three numbers, it implies one of the original numbers was not used appropriately.\n\nHowever, in 24 game rules, you can use each number exactly once. The formula uses 7, 3, and 8, totaling three numbers, but the original set has four numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nTherefore, the usage of the second 7 is missing, meaning the formula does not utilize all original numbers exactly once.\n\nHence, the formula is invalid because it does not use all original numbers exactly once, or it misuses the numbers as per the feedback.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8.  \nThe attempted formula was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLet's analyze the left numbers after this step:  \n- The used numbers are 7, 3, and 8.  \n- The remaining number is 7 (since the second 7 is not used in the formula).\n\nThe formula uses 7, 3, and 8, which are in the original set, but it does not incorporate the second 7, and it leaves one 7 unused.\n\nHowever, the feedback indicates the attempt is incorrect because the formula does not use all original numbers, which is typically required in the game unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, and considering the step as an attempt to reach 24, but not using all original numbers, we can evaluate as follows:\n\n**Formula:** (7 - 3) * 8 = 24  \n**Left numbers after step:** 7 (unused, as only 7, 3, and 8 are used)  \n\nSince the game requires using all four numbers to reach 24, and the attempt does not do so, the label should be:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8, 3, 7): impossible**", "Let's analyze the provided formula and the instructions carefully.\n\nThe original numbers are: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nThe answer attempted: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. \n\nGiven that, we need to check the left numbers after this step, which are the numbers remaining after using some numbers from the original set.\n\nIn the attempted formula:\n- Used numbers: 7, 3, 8\n- Remaining number(s): Since 7, 3, and 8 are used, the only original number not used is the remaining 7.\n\nBut in the initial step, the operation is: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nThe numbers used are 7, 3, and 8, which means the second 7 is not used.\n\nThe left numbers after this step would be: 7 (the unused original 7), assuming that the operation combined 7, 3, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the left numbers after this step are {7}.\n\nNow, for the labels:\n\n- The formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n- Left numbers: {7}\n\n- Is this formula correct and legal? \n\nNo, because the formula does not use all four original numbers, and the previous feedback indicates the numbers used are not from the original set.\n\nTherefore, the label for this step, considering the left numbers, is:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt:\n\nOriginal numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8  \nAttempted answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," indicating that at the step the formula was attempted, the left numbers were not 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nGiven this, I will reconstruct the step with the left numbers from the original problem:\n\nThe initial set of numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nThe attempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nLet\'s see what numbers are used:\n\n- 7 (from the original set)\n- 3 (from the original set)\n- 8 (from the original set)\n\nUsing these, the left numbers after performing (7 - 3) * 8 are:\n\n- The operation (7 - 3) uses 7 and 3, producing 4\n- Multiplying by 8 yields 4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut in the process, the numbers 7, 3, and 8 are used, leaving the other 7 unused.\n\nNow, the problem\'s feedback states that the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set at that step. \n\nTherefore, the formula as written:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8**\n\nuses only numbers from the original set, and is a valid calculation that results in 24:\n\n(7 - 3) = 4  \n4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut the calculation gives 32, not 24, so the formula is incorrect in terms of achieving the target 24.\n\nNow, per your instruction, I need to give labels for the formulas with the left numbers from each step.\n\nSince the original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8, and the formula uses 3, 7, and 8, the remaining number is 7 (the unused one).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24** (left: 7, 7, 8, 3) : **impossible**\n\nBecause the calculation results in 32, not 24, and the operation is invalid for achieving 24.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Formula: **(7 - 3) * 8 = 24**  \n- Left numbers after operation: 7, 7, 8, 3  \n- Label: **impossible**']

But the question asks to assign 'sure' or 'impossible' based on correctness and legality, not whether it actually yields 24.\n\nGiven that, the formula uses only numbers from the original set, and the operation is valid, and it indeed computes to 24: (7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24. So the formula does not produce 24.\n\nTherefore, the formula is mathematically valid but incorrect for producing 24.\n\nBased on the instructions, since the formula is valid but does not produce 24, it should be labeled as 'impossible' because it does not lead to 24.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible", "Let's analyze the given attempt:\n\nAttempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe left numbers from the original problem are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nIn the attempt, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8.\n\nRemaining number: Since only 7, 3, and 8 are used in the formula, and the original numbers include two 7s, the attempt appears to have used only one 7, which is inconsistent with the original set.\n\nAdditionally, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the formula is invalid in the context of the original numbers.\n\nNow, to evaluate the labels:\n\n- For the formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n  - Left numbers after this operation: Since we are using 7, 3, and 8, and assuming two 7s are available, but only one is used here, the remaining numbers would be the unused 7 and 8, or perhaps no number is left depending on the process.

The key issue is whether the formula uses each number exactly once and only from the original set. Here, 7 and 3 are used once each, and 8 once, which matches the original set.\n\nBut the feedback states: "Evaluation: Step 4 tries to give an answer but it is incorrect.

But since the feedback states the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set, and the formula uses only three numbers, it implies one of the original numbers was not used appropriately.\n\nHowever, in 24 game rules, you can use each number exactly once.

So the formula does not produce 24.\n\nTherefore, the formula is mathematically valid but incorrect for producing 24.\n\nBased on the instructions, since the formula is valid but does not produce 24, it should be labeled as 'impossible' because it does not lead to 24.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible", "Let's analyze the given attempt:\n\nAttempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe left numbers from the original problem are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nIn the attempt, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8.\n\nRemaining number: Since only 7, 3, and 8 are used in the formula, and the original numbers include two 7s, the attempt appears to have used only one 7, which is inconsistent with the original set.\n\nAdditionally, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the formula is invalid in the context of the original numbers.\n\nNow, to evaluate the labels:\n\n- For the formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n  - Left numbers after this operation: Since we are using 7, 3, and 8, and assuming two 7s are available, but only one is used here, the remaining numbers would be the unused 7 and 8, or perhaps no number is left depending on the process.

The number 7 is used twice (once as the first 7, once as the second 7), but in the step, only one 7 is used to subtract 3, and then multiply by 8. \n\nHowever, the feedback indicates that the answer uses numbers not from the original set in the step (specifically, the attempt says "Step 4: answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24" but the previous step\'s left numbers are not specified here). \n\nGiven the original set {3, 7, 7, 8}, the operation (7 - 3) * 8 involves the numbers 7, 3, and 8, which are all present. The key issue is whether the formula uses each number exactly once and only from the original set. Here, 7 and 3 are used once each, and 8 once, which matches the original set.\n\nBut the feedback states: "Evaluation: Step 4 tries to give an answer but it is incorrect.

Also, the feedback states that the numbers used do not match the original set because the step used 7 and 3, which are from the original set, but the previous step's left numbers are not specified explicitly.\n\nHowever, given the context, the main issue is that the evaluation was incorrect (since it yields 32, not 24), and the feedback states the answer is incorrect.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8): impossible", 'The attempted formula is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLeft numbers from each step: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nSince the formula uses the numbers 7, 3, and 8, but the feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used do not match the original set, I will check if the formula is valid and uses only the original numbers.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Original numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n- Formula uses: 7, 3, 8.\n- The second 7 is not used in the formula, which is acceptable as long as the overall usage of numbers matches. But since the feedback states the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set, and the formula uses only three numbers, it implies one of the original numbers was not used appropriately.\n\nHowever, in 24 game rules, you can use each number exactly once. The formula uses 7, 3, and 8, totaling three numbers, but the original set has four numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nTherefore, the usage of the second 7 is missing, meaning the formula does not utilize all original numbers exactly once.\n\nHence, the formula is invalid because it does not use all original numbers exactly once, or it misuses the numbers as per the feedback.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8.  \nThe attempted formula was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLet's analyze the left numbers after this step:  \n- The used numbers are 7, 3, and 8.  \n- The remaining number is 7 (since the second 7 is not used in the formula).\n\nThe formula uses 7, 3, and 8, which are in the original set, but it does not incorporate the second 7, and it leaves one 7 unused.\n\nHowever, the feedback indicates the attempt is incorrect because the formula does not use all original numbers, which is typically required in the game unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, and considering the step as an attempt to reach 24, but not using all original numbers, we can evaluate as follows:\n\n**Formula:** (7 - 3) * 8 = 24  \n**Left numbers after step:** 7 (unused, as only 7, 3, and 8 are used)  \n\nSince the game requires using all four numbers to reach 24, and the attempt does not do so, the label should be:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8, 3, 7): impossible**", "Let's analyze the provided formula and the instructions carefully.\n\nThe original numbers are: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nThe answer attempted: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. \n\nGiven that, we need to check the left numbers after this step, which are the numbers remaining after using some numbers from the original set.\n\nIn the attempted formula:\n- Used numbers: 7, 3, 8\n- Remaining number(s): Since 7, 3, and 8 are used, the only original number not used is the remaining 7.\n\nBut in the initial step, the operation is: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nThe numbers used are 7, 3, and 8, which means the second 7 is not used.\n\nThe left numbers after this step would be: 7 (the unused original 7), assuming that the operation combined 7, 3, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the left numbers after this step are {7}.\n\nNow, for the labels:\n\n- The formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n- Left numbers: {7}\n\n- Is this formula correct and legal? \n\nNo, because the formula does not use all four original numbers, and the previous feedback indicates the numbers used are not from the original set.\n\nTherefore, the label for this step, considering the left numbers, is:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt:\n\nOriginal numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8  \nAttempted answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," indicating that at the step the formula was attempted, the left numbers were not 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nGiven this, I will reconstruct the step with the left numbers from the original problem:\n\nThe initial set of numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nThe attempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nLet\'s see what numbers are used:\n\n- 7 (from the original set)\n- 3 (from the original set)\n- 8 (from the original set)\n\nUsing these, the left numbers after performing (7 - 3) * 8 are:\n\n- The operation (7 - 3) uses 7 and 3, producing 4\n- Multiplying by 8 yields 4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut in the process, the numbers 7, 3, and 8 are used, leaving the other 7 unused.\n\nNow, the problem\'s feedback states that the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set at that step. \n\nTherefore, the formula as written:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8**\n\nuses only numbers from the original set, and is a valid calculation that results in 24:\n\n(7 - 3) = 4  \n4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut the calculation gives 32, not 24, so the formula is incorrect in terms of achieving the target 24.\n\nNow, per your instruction, I need to give labels for the formulas with the left numbers from each step.\n\nSince the original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8, and the formula uses 3, 7, and 8, the remaining number is 7 (the unused one).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24** (left: 7, 7, 8, 3) : **impossible**\n\nBecause the calculation results in 32, not 24, and the operation is invalid for achieving 24.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Formula: **(7 - 3) * 8 = 24**  \n- Left numbers after operation: 7, 7, 8, 3  \n- Label: **impossible**', "The formula provided in the attempt was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.  \nLeft numbers after this step would be: 7, 8, 8, assuming the original set was 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nHowever, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the numbers used do not align with the original problem (3, 7, 7, 8).

Also, it doesn't use all the numbers properly to reach 24 in a valid way.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8): impossible", 'The attempted formula is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nLeft numbers from Step 4: 7, 7, 8\n\nChecking the formula:\n- It uses only the original numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.  \n- It combines 7 and 3 to get 4, then multiplies by 8 to get 32, not 24.  \n- Therefore, the calculation is incorrect for reaching 24.\n\nSince the formula does not correctly produce 24 and uses the original numbers properly, but the result is invalid, the label is:\n\n{(7 - 3) * 8 = 24} (left: 7, 7, 8): impossible', 'The attempted formula from Step 4 is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nLeft numbers from each step: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nEvaluating the formula:\n- It uses 7, 3, and 8.\n- It does not include the second 7, which was part of the original set.\n- The formula computes to (7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24.\n\nSince the formula does not use all the original numbers and does not produce 24, and the feedback indicates that the numbers used are not from the original set, this formula is invalid.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The attempted formula is:  \n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nLeft numbers from the step are: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nSince the feedback states that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original problem, and in this formula, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8, but one of the original numbers is 7, 8, 3, 7, which are all present, so the formula itself is valid in terms of numbers used.\n\nHowever, the feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because it doesn't correctly use the original set or because it doesn't produce 24. But the question asks to assign 'sure' or 'impossible' based on correctness and legality, not whether it actually yields 24.\n\nGiven that, the formula uses only numbers from the original set, and the operation is valid, and it indeed computes to 24: (7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24. So the formula does not produce 24.\n\nTherefore, the formula is mathematically valid but incorrect for producing 24.\n\nBased on the instructions, since the formula is valid but does not produce 24, it should be labeled as 'impossible' because it does not lead to 24.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible", "Let's analyze the given attempt:\n\nAttempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe left numbers from the original problem are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nIn the attempt, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8.\n\nRemaining number: Since only 7, 3, and 8 are used in the formula, and the original numbers include two 7s, the attempt appears to have used only one 7, which is inconsistent with the original set.\n\nAdditionally, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the formula is invalid in the context of the original numbers.\n\nNow, to evaluate the labels:\n\n- For the formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n  - Left numbers after this operation: Since we are using 7, 3, and 8, and assuming two 7s are available, but only one is used here, the remaining numbers would be the unused 7 and 8, or perhaps no number is left depending on the process. But since the feedback indicates using incorrect numbers, the formula is invalid in the context.\n\n  - Therefore, the label: **impossible**\n\n**Final output:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8): impossible", 'The attempted formula is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nLeft numbers from the original problem: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nIn the attempted step, the numbers used are 7, 3, and 8. The number 7 is used twice (once as the first 7, once as the second 7), but in the step, only one 7 is used to subtract 3, and then multiply by 8. \n\nHowever, the feedback indicates that the answer uses numbers not from the original set in the step (specifically, the attempt says "Step 4: answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24" but the previous step\'s left numbers are not specified here). \n\nGiven the original set {3, 7, 7, 8}, the operation (7 - 3) * 8 involves the numbers 7, 3, and 8, which are all present. The key issue is whether the formula uses each number exactly once and only from the original set. Here, 7 and 3 are used once each, and 8 once, which matches the original set.\n\nBut the feedback states: "Evaluation: Step 4 tries to give an answer but it is incorrect. The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem."\n\nThis suggests that in the previous step, the numbers used were altered or that the method of operation is invalid.\n\nSince the prompt asks to give labels based on whether the formula is correct and can lead to 24, and the attempted formula:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nevaluates correctly (since (7 - 3) = 4, and 4 * 8 = 32, which is NOT 24), the formula is mathematically incorrect to reach 24.\n\n**Therefore, the label is \'impossible\'.**\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nThe attempted formula was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLeft numbers after this step would have been: 7, 8 (since 7 and 3 were used).\n\nNow, evaluate the formula:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32, which is not 24. Also, the feedback states that the numbers used do not match the original set because the step used 7 and 3, which are from the original set, but the previous step's left numbers are not specified explicitly.\n\nHowever, given the context, the main issue is that the evaluation was incorrect (since it yields 32, not 24), and the feedback states the answer is incorrect.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8): impossible", 'The attempted formula is: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLeft numbers from each step: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nSince the formula uses the numbers 7, 3, and 8, but the feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used do not match the original set, I will check if the formula is valid and uses only the original numbers.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Original numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n- Formula uses: 7, 3, 8.\n- The second 7 is not used in the formula, which is acceptable as long as the overall usage of numbers matches. But since the feedback states the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set, and the formula uses only three numbers, it implies one of the original numbers was not used appropriately.\n\nHowever, in 24 game rules, you can use each number exactly once. The formula uses 7, 3, and 8, totaling three numbers, but the original set has four numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nTherefore, the usage of the second 7 is missing, meaning the formula does not utilize all original numbers exactly once.\n\nHence, the formula is invalid because it does not use all original numbers exactly once, or it misuses the numbers as per the feedback.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 3, 7, 7, 8): impossible', "The original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8.  \nThe attempted formula was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.\n\nLet's analyze the left numbers after this step:  \n- The used numbers are 7, 3, and 8.  \n- The remaining number is 7 (since the second 7 is not used in the formula).\n\nThe formula uses 7, 3, and 8, which are in the original set, but it does not incorporate the second 7, and it leaves one 7 unused.\n\nHowever, the feedback indicates the attempt is incorrect because the formula does not use all original numbers, which is typically required in the game unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, and considering the step as an attempt to reach 24, but not using all original numbers, we can evaluate as follows:\n\n**Formula:** (7 - 3) * 8 = 24  \n**Left numbers after step:** 7 (unused, as only 7, 3, and 8 are used)  \n\nSince the game requires using all four numbers to reach 24, and the attempt does not do so, the label should be:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: 7, 8, 3, 7): impossible**", "Let's analyze the provided formula and the instructions carefully.\n\nThe original numbers are: 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nThe answer attempted: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThe feedback indicates that the answer is incorrect because the numbers used are not from the original set. \n\nGiven that, we need to check the left numbers after this step, which are the numbers remaining after using some numbers from the original set.\n\nIn the attempted formula:\n- Used numbers: 7, 3, 8\n- Remaining number(s): Since 7, 3, and 8 are used, the only original number not used is the remaining 7.\n\nBut in the initial step, the operation is: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nThe numbers used are 7, 3, and 8, which means the second 7 is not used.\n\nThe left numbers after this step would be: 7 (the unused original 7), assuming that the operation combined 7, 3, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the left numbers after this step are {7}.\n\nNow, for the labels:\n\n- The formula: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\n- Left numbers: {7}\n\n- Is this formula correct and legal? \n\nNo, because the formula does not use all four original numbers, and the previous feedback indicates the numbers used are not from the original set.\n\nTherefore, the label for this step, considering the left numbers, is:\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(7 - 3) * 8 = 24 (left: {7}): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the provided attempt:\n\nOriginal numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8  \nAttempted answer: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24\n\nHowever, the feedback states that "the numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," indicating that at the step the formula was attempted, the left numbers were not 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nGiven this, I will reconstruct the step with the left numbers from the original problem:\n\nThe initial set of numbers: 3, 7, 7, 8\n\nThe attempted formula: (7 - 3) * 8\n\nLet\'s see what numbers are used:\n\n- 7 (from the original set)\n- 3 (from the original set)\n- 8 (from the original set)\n\nUsing these, the left numbers after performing (7 - 3) * 8 are:\n\n- The operation (7 - 3) uses 7 and 3, producing 4\n- Multiplying by 8 yields 4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut in the process, the numbers 7, 3, and 8 are used, leaving the other 7 unused.\n\nNow, the problem\'s feedback states that the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set at that step. \n\nTherefore, the formula as written:\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8**\n\nuses only numbers from the original set, and is a valid calculation that results in 24:\n\n(7 - 3) = 4  \n4 * 8 = 32\n\nBut the calculation gives 32, not 24, so the formula is incorrect in terms of achieving the target 24.\n\nNow, per your instruction, I need to give labels for the formulas with the left numbers from each step.\n\nSince the original numbers are 3, 7, 7, 8, and the formula uses 3, 7, and 8, the remaining number is 7 (the unused one).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**(7 - 3) * 8 = 24** (left: 7, 7, 8, 3) : **impossible**\n\nBecause the calculation results in 32, not 24, and the operation is invalid for achieving 24.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Formula: **(7 - 3) * 8 = 24**  \n- Left numbers after operation: 7, 7, 8, 3  \n- Label: **impossible**', "The formula provided in the attempt was: (7 - 3) * 8 = 24.  \nLeft numbers after this step would be: 7, 8, 8, assuming the original set was 3, 7, 7, 8.\n\nHowever, the feedback states that the attempt used numbers not from the original set, implying that the numbers used do not align with the original problem (3, 7, 7, 8).

But since the feedback states the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not from the original set, and the formula uses only three numbers, it implies one of the original numbers was not used appropriately.\n\nHowever, in 24 game rules, you can use each number exactly once.

But 12 was not in the original set; the original numbers are 2, 12, 13, 13. So, the formula uses 13, 13, and 12, which is invalid because 12 was not available from the original set at that step (since the original set has 2, 12, 13, 13).

However, the crucial issue is whether the steps and the usage of numbers are valid and can lead to 24.\n\n- The formula uses 13, 13, and 12, which are all from the original set.\n- The 2 is not used in the formula, but the main concern is whether the formula is valid and can lead to 24.\n\nGiven that the formula correctly evaluates to 24 and all numbers used are from the original set, the usage is valid.\n\n**However**, the evaluation feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not the original ones (probably because the user claimed to use only specific numbers in the step, but in reality, the number 2 was not used, or the step misrepresented the use). \n\nIn this particular case, since the formula uses only the original numbers and correctly results in 24, the formula itself is correct and can lead to 24, so:\n\n{(13 / 13) * 12 = 24} (left: 2, 12, 13, 13): sure']

Depending on rules, if all four numbers must be used exactly once, then this is invalid.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Formula: (12 / (13 - 13)) + 2 (left: 12, 13, 13, 2): impossible  \n- Formula: (12 + 12) - (13 + 13) (left: 12, 13, 13, 12): impossible  \n- Formula: 12 * 2 (left: 12, 13, 13, 2): depends on whether all numbers must be used; typically, "all four numbers used exactly once," so this would be impossible unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWithout the specific formulas from each step, I cannot definitively assign labels. Please provide the exact formulas or clarify if all four numbers must be used exactly once, and I will give precise labels accordingly.', 'Let\'s analyze the given attempt and the feedback.\n\nThe attempt was:\n[\'Step 4: answer: (13 / 13) * 12 = 24\']\n\nThe feedback states:\n"Evaluation: Step 4 tries to give an answer but it is incorrect. The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem."\n\nOriginal numbers are: 2, 12, 13, 13.\n\nIn the formula (13 / 13) * 12, the numbers used are 13, 13, and 12. But 12 was not in the original set; the original numbers are 2, 12, 13, 13. So, the formula uses 13, 13, and 12, which is invalid because 12 was not available from the original set at that step (since the original set has 2, 12, 13, 13). If we interpret the feedback strictly, the formula is invalid because it uses a number not present initially.\n\nNow, considering that, let\'s evaluate the remaining left numbers after applying the previous step:\n\n- The initial set: 2, 12, 13, 13\n- The formula uses 13 and 13 (which are from the original set), but 12 is also from the original set, so usage of 12 is valid.\n\nBut the key issue in the feedback is that the attempt is invalid because the formula doesn\'t follow the original numbers properly, or perhaps because the formula is not an actual step in the sequence that uses the initial numbers correctly.\n\nSince the feedback explicitly states that the formula is incorrect and the numbers used are not from the original problem, the label should be \'impossible\'.\n\nNow, per your instructions, I will repeat the formula with the current left numbers and give the label:\n\n**Formula:** (13 / 13) * 12 = 24  \n**Left numbers from this step:** Assuming the previous step used 13 and 13, and 12, the remaining numbers would depend on prior steps, but since the main issue is the use of incorrect numbers, the label is \'impossible\'.\n\n**Final output:**\n\n(13 / 13) * 12 = 24 (left: 2, 12, 13, 13): impossible', 'The formula from the attempt is: (13 / 13) * 12 = 24\n\nLeft numbers after this step: 2, 12, 13, 13\n\nSince the feedback states that the answer was incorrect because the original numbers were not used, the formula itself, as written, uses only the original numbers. However, the crucial issue is whether the steps and the usage of numbers are valid and can lead to 24.\n\n- The formula uses 13, 13, and 12, which are all from the original set.\n- The 2 is not used in the formula, but the main concern is whether the formula is valid and can lead to 24.\n\nGiven that the formula correctly evaluates to 24 and all numbers used are from the original set, the usage is valid.\n\n**However**, the evaluation feedback indicates that the attempt is invalid because the numbers used are not the original ones (probably because the user claimed to use only specific numbers in the step, but in reality, the number 2 was not used, or the step misrepresented the use). \n\nIn this particular case, since the formula uses only the original numbers and correctly results in 24, the formula itself is correct and can lead to 24, so:\n\n{(13 / 13) * 12 = 24} (left: 2, 12, 13, 13): sure', 'The attempted formula is:\n\n(13 / 13) * 12 = 24\n\nThe left numbers from the original problem are 2, 12, 13, 13.  \nIn the formula, the numbers used are 13, 13, and 12. The number 2 is not used.\n\nLeft numbers after this step would be: 2 (unused), or if we consider the numbers used, the remaining are 2, 12, with 13 and 13 used.\n\nSince the attempt only uses 13, 13, and 12, and the 2 is unused, but the question asks about the left numbers from each step, we need to clarify.\n\nGiven the feedback, the main point is that the formula uses only three of the four numbers, ignoring the 2, which is illegal because all four numbers should be used exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the formula is invalid because it does not use all four original numbers.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n(13 / 13) * 12 = 24 (left: 2, 12, 13, 13): impossible']

However, the feedback indicates it's invalid because the numbers are not correctly used or perhaps because the operation is invalid given the previous steps.\n\nSince the feedback explicitly says the numbers used are not from the original set, the formula is considered illegal or incorrect in the context of the game rules.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{(12 / 6) * 12 = 24} (left: 1, 6, 12, 12): impossible", 'Let\'s analyze the attempted formula:\n\n**Attempted formula:** (12 / 6) * 12 = 24\n\n**Left numbers from this step:** 1, 6, 12, 12\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- The formula uses 6 and 12, which are present in the original set.\n- However, it also uses 12 again, which is acceptable as using the same number multiple times is allowed if there are multiple copies, and the original set has two 12s, so that\'s okay.\n- The number 1 is not used in the formula.\n- The initial set is 1, 6, 12, 12, but the formula uses only 6 and 12, and ignores 1.\n\n**Important note from the feedback:** The previous answer tried to use all numbers, but the formula itself didn\'t use 1. The game typically allows using each number exactly once unless multiple copies exist, which they do here for 12.\n\nBut the critical point is whether the formula is valid:\n\n- It uses 6 and 12 to produce 24: (12 / 6) * 12 = (2) * 12 = 24\n- It uses one 12 and 6, and the other 12 is unused.\n\nSince the original set includes 1, 6, 12, 12, and the formula only uses 6 and 12, not 1, the numbers used are 6 and 12 (twice). The remaining numbers are 1 and 12 (the other 12). The formula does not use 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The formula is a valid way to produce 24 using the numbers 6 and 12 (and the second 12), but it ignores the number 1.\n\n**Based on the feedback:** "The numbers you use are not the original numbers from the problem," suggests that the entire set of four numbers must be used exactly once in the solution.\n\nSince the attempted formula does not include 1 at all, it is considered invalid in that context.\n\n**Final labeling:**\n\n`(12 / 6) * 12 = 24 (left: 1, 6, 12, 12): impossible`', "Let's analyze the attempted formula:\n\nAttempted formula: 12 / 6 * 2 = 24\n\nLeft numbers after this step: 12, 6, 12, 12\n\nEvaluation:\n- The original numbers are 1, 6, 12, 12.\n- In the formula, the number 2 appears, which was not part of the original set.\n- The step uses 2, which is not among the original numbers, so this step is invalid.\n- Therefore, this formula cannot be a valid solution based on the original numbers.\n\nNow, expressing the formula with the left numbers from this step:\n\n{12 / 6 * 2 = 24} (left: 12, 6, 12, 12): impossible"]

So this is illegal.\n- 4 + 1 = 5 (left: 2, 8, 5) — but 5 is not in the initial set, so not valid as a first step.\n- 8 / 4 = 2 (left: 1, 2, 2) — again, using 2 twice is only valid if the original set has two 2s, which it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the only legal first steps are:\n\n**Possible initial steps:**\n\n1. 8 - 4 = 4 (left: 1, 2, 4)  \n2. 8 / 2 = 4 (left: 1, 4, 4) — illegal because it uses 4 twice when only one 4 exists.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1:** 8 - 4 = 4 (left: 1, 2, 4)  \nLabel: sure or impossible?\n\n- The operation is legal; used original numbers 8 and 4.\n- Left numbers: 1, 2, 4.\n\nThis is a valid step, and the set is now {1, 2, 4}.\n\n**Label:**  \n`8 - 4 = 4 (left: 1, 2, 4): sure`\n\n---\n\n**Option 2:** 8 / 2 = 4 (left: 1, 4, 4)  \nLabel: sure or impossible?\n\n- Used original numbers 8 and 2.\n- Left numbers: 1, 4, 4.\n\nBut since original set contains only one 4, using 4 twice is illegal unless we generated the second 4, which we haven't.
