Specifically, "1 + 9 = 10" is valid, but then "6 + 10 = 16" and "9 + 16 = 25" are incorrect because the previous "9" was already used or not properly combined, leading to an incorrect intermediate total and ultimately moving further away from 24.\n\n2. The sequence disregards proper pairing and use of all four numbers; the approach does not systematically explore combinations that could produce 24, causing the attempt to diverge from the goal.\n\n3. The calculations are inconsistent with the rules: numbers are used more than once or not appropriately combined, making the solution invalid or impossible within the rules.\n\nIn summary, the attempt contains invalid steps and misuses numbers, resulting in a sequence that does not solve the puzzle correctly or reliably.']
Current step for agent 0: 13 - 6 = 7 (left: 4 7) 

Step 2 : Stepping
reflexion in step:  ['The main mistakes are:\n\n1. Invalid operations: The steps "2 + 4 = 6" and "6 + 6 = 12" are not valid because they treat intermediate results as equations rather than using arithmetic operations directly on the numbers. The puzzle requires combining the original four numbers with +, -, *, /, not forming equalities.\n\n2. Inconsistent handling: The solution treats the intermediate results as separate numbers, but it doesn\'t follow the rules of the game, which require combining the original numbers step-by-step to reach 24, not just performing standalone calculations.\n\n3. No attempt to reach 24: The steps do not attempt to produce 24 explicitly; instead, they produce intermediate totals that do not lead to 24, indicating the approach was not focused on solving the puzzle.\n\nOverall, the solution is invalid because it misapplies the rules and fails to systematically combine the initial numbers toward 24.', 'The main mistakes are:\n\n1. **Invalid operations or steps:** The initial step "2 + 4 = 6" is valid, but the subsequent step "6 + 6 = 12" implies combining the previous 6 with another 6, which wasn\'t derived from the previous operation (the initial 6 came from 2+4). This suggests inconsistent use of numbers.\n\n2. **Misuse of numbers:** The attempt treats the intermediate sums as new numbers without properly tracking which original numbers are used, leading to ambiguity.\n\n3. **No clear path to 24:** The sequence doesn\'t logically lead to 24; instead, it results in 1, which is further from 24, indicating the approach doesn\'t solve the puzzle.\n\nOverall, the steps are inconsistent and don\'t follow the rules of combining the original four numbers exactly once, resulting in an invalid or unsolvable attempt.']
