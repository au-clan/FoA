    "solution": "Step 1: Conservation of Kinetic Energy\nIn an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy before and after the collision remains constant. Since the initial kinetic energies of the two particles are equal, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_2u_2^2$\n\nStep 2: Conservation of Momentum\nIn an elastic collision, linear momentum is conserved. Using the conservation of momentum, we can write:\n\n$m_1u_1 = m_1v_1$\n\n$m_2u_2 = m_2v_2$\n\nwhere $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the final velocities of particles 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Solving for Final Velocities\nSince $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, $v_1 = 0$. Using the conservation of momentum equations, we can solve for $v_2$ in terms of $u_1$ and $\\alpha$:\n\n$m_1u_1 = m_1(0) = 0$\n\n$m_2u_2 = m_2v_2$\n\n$v_2 = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}u_2$\n\n$v_2 = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\alpha u_1$\n\nStep 4: Substituting into Conservation of Kinetic Energy Equation\nNow we substitute $v_2$ into the conservation of kinetic energy equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_2(\\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\alpha u_1)^2$\n\n$m_1u_1^2 = \\frac{m_1^2}{m_2}\\alpha^2u_1^2$\n\n$u_1^2 = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\alpha^2u_1^2$\n\n$1 = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\alpha^2$\n\n$\\alpha^2 = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_2}{m_1}}$\n\nSince $\\alpha$ is positive, we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{m_2}{m_1}} > 0$\n\nTherefore, the conditions on $u_1/u_2$ such that $m_1$ is at rest after the collision and $\\alpha$ is positive are:\n\n$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_2}{m_1}}$\n\nThe unit of the answer is 1.",

    "content": "Astronaut Stumblebum wanders too far away from the space shuttle orbiter while repairing a broken communications satellite. Stumblebum realizes that the orbiter is moving away from him at $3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Stumblebum and his maneuvering unit have a mass of $100 \\mathrm{~kg}$, including a pressurized tank of mass $10 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The tank includes only $2 \\mathrm{~kg}$ of gas that is used to propel him in space. The gas escapes with a constant velocity of $100 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. With what velocity will Stumblebum have to throw the empty tank away to reach the orbiter? The unit of the answer should be $ \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ .",
    "solution": "1. First, we need to calculate the initial velocity of Stumblebum and his maneuvering unit before he throws away the tank. This can be done using the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of Stumblebum and his unit is:\n\n$100 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 0 \\mathrm{~m/s} = 0$\n\nThe initial momentum of the gas in the tank is:\n\n$2 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 100 \\mathrm{~m/s} = 200 \\mathrm{~kg \\cdot m/s}$\n\nSo the initial total momentum is $200 \\mathrm{~kg \\cdot m/s}$.\n\n2. After Stumblebum throws away the tank, the total momentum of the system should still be $200 \\mathrm{~kg \\cdot m/s}$ since there are no external forces acting on the system. Let's denote the velocity at which Stumblebum throws the tank away as $v$. The momentum of the tank after being thrown away is:\n\n$10 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times v$\n\nThe momentum of Stumblebum after throwing the tank away is:\n\n$90 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times v$\n\nThe momentum of the gas in the tank after being thrown away is:\n\n$2 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 100 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nSetting up the conservation of momentum equation:\n\n$10v + 90v + 200 = 200$\n\n$100v = 0$\n\n$v = 0 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nTherefore, Stumblebum does not need to throw the tank away in order to reach the orbiter. The empty tank can simply be let go, and Stumblebum will eventually reach the orbiter due to the conservation of momentum.",
