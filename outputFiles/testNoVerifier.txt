Since the initial attempt and feedback are not provided, I'll create a general approach to solving this type of puzzle.\n\nGiven numbers: 1, 3, 4, 6\n\nA common approach to solving 24 puzzles involves trying to combine the numbers in various ways to get closer to 24. Let's consider a few initial steps and evaluate them:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Combine two numbers to get a starting point.\n   - Example: (4 * 6) = 24 (left: 1, 3): sure\n   - This step directly achieves 24, making it a 'sure' path.\n\n2. **Step 2:** Try to get a useful intermediate result.\n   - Example: (3 + 1) = 4 (left: 4, 6): sure\n   - This step creates a new number that could potentially be used to get 24, but we need to consider further operations.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Attempt to incorporate all numbers.\n   - Example: ((6 - 1) * (4 - 3)) = 5 * 1 = 5 (left: none, but not reaching 24 directly): impossible\n   - This operation does not lead directly to 24 and does not leave numbers to further manipulate, making it 'impossible' as a standalone path to 24.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Another attempt to incorporate all numbers.\n   - Example: (6 * (4 - 1)) / 3 = (6 * 3) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 (left: 1): impossible\n   - This operation simplifies to a number that is not 24 and does not provide a straightforward path to 24 with the remaining numbers, making it 'impossible'.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Direct calculation.\n   - Example: (6 * 4) = 24 (left: 1, 3): sure\n   - This step directly achieves 24, making it a 'sure' path.\n\nFrom the examples above, we can see that certain combinations directly lead to 24 ('sure' labels), while others either do not lead to 24 or do not provide a clear path forward ('impossible' labels). The goal is to find a sequence of operations that uses all four numbers exactly once to get as close to 24 as possible, ideally reaching it exactly. \n\nGiven the specific numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, one of the most straightforward solutions is:\n(4 * 6) = 24, which directly achieves 24 without needing further operations, making it a 'sure' path.\n\nTherefore, the formula with the left numbers from each step would be labeled as follows:\n- (4 * 6) (left: 1, 3): sure\n- Other combinations that do not directly lead to 24 or leave numbers that cannot be used to reach 24 would be labeled 'impossible'."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Now use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to generate possible next steps.

'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "What you have learned about the puzzle are summarized below.\nThe given attempt answer is: \n['Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (left: 4 4 6)']\n\nSo, the formula with left numbers from each step is: \n1 + 3 = 4 (left: 4 4 6): impossible \n\nThe reason is that the calculation 1 + 3 indeed equals 4, but the result 4 and the remaining numbers 4 and 6 cannot be used with basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to get 24. For example, (4 + 4 + 6) = 14, (4 * 4 + 6) = 22, (4 + 4 * 6) = 28, (4 * 4 - 6) = 10, (4 + 4 - 6) = 2, and (4 - 4 + 6) = 6, none of which equals 24. Also, division operations like (4 + 4) / 6 or (4 * 4) / 6 do not yield 24. Hence, the given attempt is labeled 'impossible'.\n6 - 1 = 5 (left: 3 4 5): impossible\nTo solve the given puzzle with numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, and to label each step as 'sure' or 'impossible' based on the attempt to reach 24 using arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), let's break down the process step by step. Since the initial attempt and feedback are not provided, I'll create a general approach to solving this type of puzzle.\n\nGiven numbers: 1, 3, 4, 6\n\nA common approach to solving 24 puzzles involves trying to combine the numbers in various ways to get closer to 24. Let's consider a few initial steps and evaluate them:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Combine two numbers to get a starting point.\n   - Example: (4 * 6) = 24 (left: 1, 3): sure\n   - This step directly achieves 24, making it a 'sure' path.\n\n2. **Step 2:** Try to get a useful intermediate result.\n   - Example: (3 + 1) = 4 (left: 4, 6): sure\n   - This step creates a new number that could potentially be used to get 24, but we need to consider further operations.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Attempt to incorporate all numbers.\n   - Example: ((6 - 1) * (4 - 3)) = 5 * 1 = 5 (left: none, but not reaching 24 directly): impossible\n   - This operation does not lead directly to 24 and does not leave numbers to further manipulate, making it 'impossible' as a standalone path to 24.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Another attempt to incorporate all numbers.\n   - Example: (6 * (4 - 1)) / 3 = (6 * 3) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 (left: 1): impossible\n   - This operation simplifies to a number that is not 24 and does not provide a straightforward path to 24 with the remaining numbers, making it 'impossible'.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Direct calculation.\n   - Example: (6 * 4) = 24 (left: 1, 3): sure\n   - This step directly achieves 24, making it a 'sure' path.\n\nFrom the examples above, we can see that certain combinations directly lead to 24 ('sure' labels), while others either do not lead to 24 or do not provide a clear path forward ('impossible' labels). The goal is to find a sequence of operations that uses all four numbers exactly once to get as close to 24 as possible, ideally reaching it exactly. \n\nGiven the specific numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, one of the most straightforward solutions is:\n(4 * 6) = 24, which directly achieves 24 without needing further operations, making it a 'sure' path.\n\nTherefore, the formula with the left numbers from each step would be labeled as follows:\n- (4 * 6) (left: 1, 3): sure\n- Other combinations that do not directly lead to 24 or leave numbers that cannot be used to reach 24 would be labeled 'impossible'."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Now use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to generate possible next steps.
