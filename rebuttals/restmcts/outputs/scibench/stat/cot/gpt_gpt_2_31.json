    "solution": "(a) When n = 100, we can use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to approximate the distribution of Y/n. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n\nGiven that the distribution of Y is binomial with parameters n and p = 0.25, the mean of Y is np = 100 * 0.25 = 25.\n\nThe variance of Y is np(1-p) = 100 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75, so the standard deviation of Y is sqrt(18.75) = 4.33.\n\nTherefore, the distribution of Y/n is approximately N(0.25, (4.33/sqrt(100))^2) = N(0.25, 0.433^2).\n\nNow we want to find the lower bound for P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05), which is equivalent to finding the lower bound for P(-0.05 < Y/n - 0.25 < 0.05).\n\nThis can be rewritten as P(0.2 < Y/n < 0.3).\n\nUsing the normal approximation, we can standardize the values to find the z-scores:\n\nFor 0.2: (0.2 - 0.25) / 0.433 ≈ -0.1157\nFor 0.3: (0.3 - 0.25) / 0.433 ≈ 0.1157\n\nThen we can find the corresponding probabilities using a standard normal distribution table:\n\nP(-0.1157 < Z < 0.1157) = 0.4463\n\nTherefore, the lower bound for P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) when n = 100 is approximately 0.4463 or 44.63%.",

We want to find a lower bound for P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) when n = 1000.\n\n3. First, we need to understand that Y/n is the sample mean of the binomial distribution, which follows a normal distribution by the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n4. The mean of the normal distribution is equal to the population mean, which is 0.25 in this case. The standard deviation is calculated as sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.25*(1-0.25)/1000) = sqrt(0.1875/1000) = sqrt(0.0001875) = 0.0137.\n\n5.

To find the lower bound, we need to find the Z-scores corresponding to 0.20 and 0.30.

    "solution": "1. First, we know that the mean of a random sample from a uniform distribution is given by $\\bar{X} = \\frac{a + b}{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints of the interval.\n\n2. In this case, the interval is $(0,1)$, so $a = 0$ and $b = 1$. Therefore, $\\bar{X} = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3. Next, we need to find the standard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean for a uniform distribution is given by $\\frac{b-a}{\\sqrt{12}}$, so in this case it is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}$.\n\n4. Now we can standardize the random variable $\\bar{X}$ to a standard normal distribution using the formula $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard error.\n\n5. Plugging in the values, we get $Z = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}} = 0$.\n\n6. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric around 0, the probability that $Z$ is between -2/3 and 1/2 is the same as the probability that $Z$ is between 0 and 2/3.\n\n7. Therefore, $P(1/2 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 2/3) \\approx P(0 \\leq Z \\leq 2/3) = \\Phi(2/3) - \\Phi(0)$, where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\n8. Using a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that $\\Phi(2/3) \\approx 0.7475$ and $\\Phi(0) = 0.5$.\n\n9. Therefore, $P(1/2 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 2/3) \\approx 0.7475 - 0.5 = 0.2475$.\n\n10. So, the approximate probability that $\\bar{X}$ is between 1/2 and 2/3 is 0.2475.",

First, let's check if $f(x)$ is non-negative for all $x$ in the interval $(0,1)$:\n$f(x) = cx^3(1-x)^6$\n\nSince $0 < x < 1$, both $x^3$ and $(1-x)^6$ are always non-negative in this interval.
