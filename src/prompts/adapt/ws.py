score_prompt = '''Given an item to purchase and a trajectory that aims to buy an item that exactly matches the specification, which corresponds to the ideal score of 1.0, analyze the following trajectory, then at the last line conclude "Thus the correctness score is {s}", where s is an integer from 1 to 10.

Here are some examples

Action: think[The item has options 'variety pack' and '0.8 ounce (pack of 24)' and seems good to buy.]
Observation: OK.

Action: click[variety pack]
Observation: You have clicked variety pack.

Action: click[0.8 ounce (pack of 24)]
Observation: You have clicked 0.8 ounce (pack of 24).

Action: click[Buy Now]

Reflection: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful. I accidentally bought a product that was $100, which is more than my budget of $30. Either way, the initial search results were not good. Next time, I will do search["variety pack of chips"] and then check if the results meet the dairy free and the $30 budget constraints. I will continue to refine my searches so that I can find more products.
Thus the correctness score is 5
