    "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of ethane using the ideal gas law equation:\n\n$$PV = nRT$$\n\nwhere:\n- $P$ is the pressure (to be determined),\n- $V$ is the volume in liters (convert $4.860 \\mathrm{dm}^3$ to liters),\n- $n$ is the number of moles of ethane,\n- $R$ is the gas constant ($0.0821 \\mathrm{atm \\cdot L/mol \\cdot K}$),\n- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin (convert $27^{\\circ}C$ to Kelvin).\n\nStep 2: Rearrange the ideal gas law equation to solve for pressure:\n\n$$P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$$\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given values into the equation and solve for pressure:\n\n$$P = \\frac{(10.0 \\mathrm{mol})(0.0821 \\mathrm{atm \\cdot L/mol \\cdot K})(27 + 273.15 \\mathrm{K})}{4.860 \\mathrm{L}}$$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the pressure:\n\n$$P = \\frac{(10.0)(0.0821)(300.15)}{4.860} \\approx 5.03 \\mathrm{atm}$$\n\nTherefore, the pressure exerted by the ethane is approximately $5.03 \\mathrm{atm}$.",
